boy meet danger world run help fight bravely come face face right scared life
watch spaceship turn glow flare jet think father warning boy duty son eye ear open alarm
alert

dream come true tremble watch silver hulk aim jet ground begin come
slip past roar
fire redden hillside
settle jarring thud
silence
edge forward peer glen
dust smoke clear ship gleam evilly twilight
think hear landing
soon come fight invader
find quiver fear brand coward
sudden metallic clanging jump
light flick
suck deep breath
stand platform trap door
squat fat silvery white
like insect find flat rock
hold light
carry strange looking box
way ladder begin set box ground
chance tell
busy climb hill escape
step stub toe rock jar loose send pelt
hurry look
wrinkle skin hang bulgy body thick fold
feeler wave humped
flat expressionless face glitter light lamp
shudder
look rock start climb direction roll
stay beam light guide way
cringe hill ledge point curl past jutting crag
hide view run
soon gasp horror stricken
vague shadow ledge pinch inward till gulfe black sheer cliff
trap hope coming town people listen noise approach
hear scuffle crest ledge
possible know landing town people come
lot life depend

let beam light ledge ahead touch crag spill stand
charge eye draw gleam sharp edge rock
grip poise strike come bend
thing hesitate

hear speak friend vicious destroyer
tight grip rock
notice fill new loathing
wrong appearance

bash rock faceplate
web cluster tiny crack
strike helmet split open pulp face reddish smear
suddenly roaring fill ear
lace terrible pain

claw air way
light look form turn race madly ship
overcome peculiar feeling excitement
pain ebb feel hot feverish
want act
think scurry hill fleeing figure
catch ladder trap door grab leg jerk
plunge ground hit crash
