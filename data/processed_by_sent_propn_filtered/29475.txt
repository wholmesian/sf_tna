right hole desperate fugitive leap propeller suddenly scream arch high air dive rending splintering crash upper sheet ice
sun cloudless perfect day beat man eagerly reach open entrance port
daze batter hurt joint conscious find torpoon port open feel hand reach clasp
wearily help lift thin sunlight
sit slit eye sudden glare peer
support hand pound bearded scientist rest man
great gulp clean cold air
taste good shout
know
food till plane come
stop search
word remind
oh plane
tell steal torpoon tell fellow come right
grin glance batter steel shell bear water
finish
little damage promise good new
