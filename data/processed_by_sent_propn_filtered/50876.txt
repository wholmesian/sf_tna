want space
wait long time hour official ceremony escape crowd planetlubber babbling eligible daughter stupid self admiration
pay nose mean money worth
exit lead little balcony desert
deep breath night air eye unconsciously star
come mistake need money
want real deepspace hero help celebrate hundredth anniversary
finish pick
damn silly speech award damn planet billion star pot plant soft sigh
swing head relax man look
eye dark glass direct sky
voice whisper
high pitch voice odd accent poetry ancient yearning
small shrivel old man
shoulder bent
long beard dark glass cover face entirely conceal deep wrinkle moonlight
feel sudden touch pity close know
platform memory good
award publicly year faithful service space boot
good cobbler boot help man
old man hand sweep star fall grip rail tightly
gold watch time mean
cheap world cruise ticket
spot world want
laugh harshly
forgive sound bitter
earth stare incredulously
old man
oh try
utterly weary look star dream
fail early rigid physical
thing easy try
plague ground ship
strike delay
explode pad board save
realize mean wait
stay space boot
impulse force unexpected word lip
hour spare cabin maryloo
come
old hand grip arm oddly gentle
bless
work
order remain
order man ground forever
come drag
old man hesitate expect mean
sigh lift dark glass
meet gaze second
eye drop memory fade
vault balcony railing begin run away ship unconfined reach space
eternal wanderer tarry wait
