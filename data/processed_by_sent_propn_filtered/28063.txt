logical step ordinarily military want know final detail war plan
logically problem man
frankly lot important thing
physicist glance
general quizzical expression face look mean decisive
like problem hand general ask innocently
man quick look wristwatch
long
late
long general chair
long agree
lifetime
man grunt doorway leave general office
dark deserted hallway footstep echo hollowly
overemphasize seriousness problem man
rank member resign commission straight violent ward session computer
man scowl
area face turn red
entire building secure edifice mister
live people inside hour
chance
want sure
explain computer little change subject know expect
good idea man
tell modern complex delicate computer world
like attempt
know like man agree
know suppose build simulate actual war situation
fight war computer
war missile bomb gas
real war complete tiny detail
computer tell actually happen missile city man
die plane lose truck fail start cold morning battle win lose
interrupt
computer run analysis happen
man gesture impatiently
game simulation new
year
yes machine different point
detailed war game
logical step development machine simulate war game
hesitate dramatically
add variation encephalograph
man stop walk
electro encephalograph
know recording device read electrical pattern brain
like electro cardiograph
oh
reverse twist
instead use machine recording brain electrical wave output develop device computer readout tape turn electrical pattern brain
sit machine control console
helmet place head
set machine operation
result
yes
instead read row figure computer printer
actually war fight
complete visual auditory hallucination
watch progress battle change strategy tactic result eye
idea originally easy visualize strategic situation
use machine resign commission insane add
man cock eye
use computer
resign crack
nod
man comment computer right inside doorway
let building
step
physicist general man room fill row massive console
transistorize subminiaturize course explain
way build detail machine small fit inside single building
single building oh yes control section
building circuit memory bank rest
illustration schelling finally small desk stud control button dial
single spotlight desk light brilliantly harsh contrast semidarkness rest room
run computer controlling
sit watch happen
general sit pad chair don grotesque headgear connect desk half dozen wire
man chair slowly
bulky helmet look squint little bright light
damage goodness
mean mentally course
affect way
reaction computer se
civilian use computer ill effect
use time
man nod close transparent visor face
sit watch press series button turn dial
hear general voice came muffle helmet
yes
right
familiar
standard war game
man acquaint
watch general flip switch sit fold arm chest
row light desk console begin blink
end row beginning
poise incredibly space funny blurry double sighted dream like way
picture hear voice
mixed weird kind sense
panicked instant want rip helmet head
illusion tell force calm unwilling nerve
illusion
strangely real
watch
right arch coast southeastern
start remember discovery missile bear submarine
watch area perch satellite underwater close menacing shadowy figure submarine glide crystal sea
patrol plane spot submarine send urgent radio warning
underwater picture dissolve bewildering burst bubble
missile launch
second burst time nuclear depth charge utterly destroy submarine
confusing
everyplace
detail overpower total picture agonizingly clear
submarine fire missile
immediately sink late
basis obliterate hydrogen fusion warhead
man familiar opening stage war
missile fire signal fleet missile bomber launch
confusing world time tell fireball mushroom cloud
difference
hour war
defensive system operate anti missile
system expensive compare attack rocket
cheap build deterrent defend
missile flash submarine railway car underground silo stratospheric jet secret fire automatically certain airbase command post cease beam restrain radio signal
defensive system simply overload
bomb run missile carry dust germ gas
day firelit night
boost coast enter death
man think
missile
airplane exhaust
nation build weapon long exist
rule know war end
fighting end
machine know
way kill enemy
test way
army fight continent army march overland splash ashore sea drop sky
incredibly war
tank run gas flame thrower useless prosaic artillery piece round fire simple gun simple bayonet sword
proud army descendent relive evolution reverse
war
slowly inevitably army split apart small small unit torture countryside recently feel impact nuclear war know tread band armed marauder
tiny savage group strand alien land far home family know destroy carry mockery war live land fight countryman occasion suit revive ancient terror hand wield personal head time killing
man watch world disintegrate
death individual business long mass produce
agonized fascination myriad way man die
murder
radiation disease toxic gas linger drift innocent wind finally efficient destroyer starvation
billion people meaningless million live planet war begin
tenuous thread civilization burn away kill fighting succumb inexorably starvation
die course
life
lucky
long darkness settle world
life pitiful bitter hateful suspicious savage
city pesthole
book fuel
die
completely planet earth
helmet lift slowly head
man find weak raise arm help
shiver damp perspiration
quietly military man crack use computer
pale
man conscience direct military operation know consequence man strike cigarette pull hard
exhale sharply
war game
like plan bad
pick average
brushfire game hand end like
intend general
handle espionage yes general look
logical step damn certain plan computer
fast
