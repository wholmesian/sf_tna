sir
temperature fall fast rubberoid space suit cozy chill
happy hear weightless sensation pretty queer feel upside rightside bad effect

huh oh yes beautiful right mention
time aesthetic
close tenth meteor whiz past
think flak bombing run
help wince meteor pepper past
flak space
meteor flare brightly hit atmosphere

cosmic ray sir sure reading shoot double
feel thing
like suspect invent lot advance space
feel fine cosmic ray intensity
yeah yeah star shine wink

sir
look dish shape concave
way unexpected
hurricane coast
sir install permanent space station easy spot typhoon volcano eruption tidal wave earthquake moment start
ask good telescope spot forest fire minute break mention sneak bombing target city uh sorry forget
break retch stomach turn flip flop end flip flop

voice calm
hello
listen
expect
hold hat sir sit
discover second moon
hear right second moon tie
tiny mile diameter
black color
guess telescope spot
tiny black blend black backdrop space
terrific speed
little maverick gravitational field catch rocket
course yank away gravity trouble yipe rocket moonlet mutual collision course
train eye suddenly grim possibility
barrel narrow orbit speed near mile hour tiny new moon ascent charge directly downward free fall
chance thousand direct hit add factor moonlet exert gravity pull million ton bulk warp rocket path
thousand odd wipe money
tuck report answer excited pleading question

rocket leave
way terra firma
pardon saying sir silly question
course scared scared green
sorry rocket lose
sir thank sir
stop apologize know duplicate ready rescue rocket
listen moment long break roughly
oh sake stop cry sir
forget sir
grin suddenly
look kick flash glory headline way credit history book man discover moon ask blush reply
lay man scared silly inside
look report
little runt moon track probably hour minus
remember right look head west
pretty terrific eye view world hour oxygen got leave
eh look watch fascination majestic wheeling
little moonlet rotate rotate revolution face earthward uninterrupted view
hove clear view broad
follow

dead airless pip squeak planetoid big mile thick rock probably
life vegetation people
guess joke quarter hour oxygen leave gauge minute sound like way
sir voice faint
request favor maybe
pick body day rocket
yeah stay preserved deep freeze space
thank sir

reach lung fill air density time oxygen
danger begin heat like meteor air friction
fling prayer follow twin parachute design extreme initial shock
hold
slow paratrooper drift rest way
wait puzzled pilot object
story hang
moonlet mile away gravity throw like stone
