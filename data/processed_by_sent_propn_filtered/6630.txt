good quote length book
sight comprehensible world appear stable cool unstable afterward dissociate entirely
explain phenomenon inquire astronomical observation allow witness dissociation
know stability body motion bicycle cease possible velocity rotation descend certain limit
limit reach lose stability fall ground
interpret radio activity manner point speed element compose atom descend certain limit unstable tend lose equilibrium
result commencement dissociation diminution potential energy corresponding increase kinetic energy sufficient launch space product intra atomic disintegration
forget atom enormous reservoir energy fact comparable explosive body
remain inert long internal equilibrium undisturbed
soon cause modifie explode smash break piece
atom grow old consequence diminution intra atomic energy gradually lose stability
moment arrive stability weak matter disappear sort explosion rapid
body radium group offer image phenomenon faint image atom body reach period instability dissociation slow
