final glory die system

final group

manipulate magnilen bring near
vast icy cap encompass world

climb wearily steep passage city

thousand work problem save extinction
slow work damnably slow hard know heart time
raise face red orb heat scarcely touch
marvel disaster come suddenly
solar radiation suppose end like millennia
scientist preach
end scarcely year ago
know city far meager warmth light

imagination yes
dimmer perceptibly
solar radiation electronic theory merely exhaust outer sheath electron

know orbit
save
forlorn chance
know course small planet scarcely large moon
pursue orbit close

meteor like patch light reddish sunglow

half minute watch small disappear
shake head puzzlement
beat minute feeling yes right straight
scarcely aware fierce grip arm
directly center maroon tiny pinpoint appear
watch mushroom slowly outward
meteor exclaim
cause explosion travel speed light tremendous bulk
doubt strike orbital velocity cause display hour watch
end time whitish glow sign recede slightly large
stare entrance new hope
place hand arm murmur inscrutable wisdom
