sudden crash hang sharply air tree hit lightning distance away
stop puzzle
blast quickly sound scream faintly
frown worry sound momentarily forget watch step foot suddenly plunge ant hill throw jungle floor
curse tenth time stand uncertainly dimness
tall moss shroud tree wrist thick vine hang quietly scrape spongy ground like tentacle monstrous tree bind octopus
fitful little plant grow straggly shadow mossy trunk form dense underbrush walk difficult
midday blue sun ray filter jungle floor late afternoon planet shadow long gloomy
peer vine drape shadow listen soft rustling faint twig snapping life jungle
short pop sound echo stillness drown immediately silence explosive crash
start blaster fighting suddenly anxious slash hurried tree mark position turn follow line similar mark jungle
try run vine block way woody shrub catch leg trip hold
tree clearing camp site temporary home scout ship man human jungle planet
step low shrubbery edge site look open area temporary structure camp headquarters power supply computer sleep quarter
nose high stand silver scout ship bring advance exploratory party scientist technician day
killer robot roll slowly camp site quiet tread
finally thing work
smile slightly
guess mean owe bourbon soda sure
anybody build robot hunt home animal mind impulse
step forward roar blue flame dissolve branch tree barely head
pause think leap fall sprawl bush robot roll silently right lower blaster barrel aim directly head
freeze
build thing wrong suddenly screeching whirlwind claws tooth hurl smolder branch crash robot claw insanely antenna blaster barrel
awkward jerk robot swing fire blaster completely dissolve low half cat creature barrel
pressure cat body overload discharge circuit
robot start shake click sharply overload relay snap short blaster cell
killer turn roll camp leave
crawl foot undergrowth lie watch camp
visibility difference robot feel safe hide

maybe green eye change color light soft brown hair happy smile end thirty year loneliness reason living
kill unclenche fist wipe palm bloody fingernail dig flesh
slight creak like protesting branch heavily laden
ready roll
movement elbow strike small earthy mound instantly engulf swarm locust like insect beat disgustingly eye mouth
wave arm face jump backwards away bug
dark shapeless thing plop tree spot lie stretch
like ambient fungus slither jungle undergrowth
split second jungle stand frozen brilliant blue flash follow sharp report blaster
whirl startle
planet double moon rise robot roll slowly clearing general direction blast indiscriminately mind impulse come pickup range bird insect
seven leave camp headquarters area head jungle slightly different spot
apparently robot sense know effective range pickup device
begin slide jungle
minute later look machine yard away alter course head directly
stomach tighten
dank musty smell jungle instant thicken choke throat
think big ship landing morning settle slowly lonely week voyage
think brown haired girl crowd gangway eager embrace new planet instant charred unrecognizable victim design error misplace wire machine
