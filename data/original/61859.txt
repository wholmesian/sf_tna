                         THE ULTIMATE SALIENT

                           By NELSON S. BOND

               Brian O'Shea, man of the Future, here is
                your story. Read it carefully, soldier
             yet unborn, for upon it,--and upon you--will
                 one day rest the fate of all Mankind.

_He glanced at me slowly, and a bit sadly, I thought. "I'm sorry,
Clinton," he said, "but that won't do. It won't do at all. It will have
to be written. You see--you won't be here then...."_

I thought at first he was the census-snoop, returning to poke his
proboscis into whatever few stray facts he might have overlooked the
first time. My wife was out, and when I saw him coming up the walk,
that bulky folder under his arm, I answered the door myself--something
I seldom do--sensing a sort of reluctant duty toward the minions of
Uncle Sam.

       *       *       *       *       *

He was a neat and quiet person. One of those drab, utterly commonplace
men who defy description. Neither young nor old, tall nor short, stout
nor slender. He had only one outstanding characteristic. An eager
intensity, a _piercingness_ of gaze that made you feel, somehow, as if
his ice-blue eyes stared ever into strange and fathomless depths.

He said, "Mr. Clinton?" and I nodded. "_Eben_ Clinton?" he asked. Then,
a trifle breathlessly I thought, "Mr. Clinton, I have here something
that I know will prove of the greatest interest to you--"

I got it then. I shook my head. "Sorry, pal. But we don't need some." I
started to close the door.

"I--I beg your pardon?" he stammered. "Some?"

"Shoelaces," I told him firmly, "patent can-openers or fancy soaps.
Weather-vanes, life insurance or magazines." I grinned at him. "I don't
_read_ the damned things, buddy, I just write for them."

And again I tried to do things to the door. But he beat me to it.
There was apology in the way he shrugged his way into the house, but
determination in his eyes.

"I know," he said. "That is, I _didn't_ know until I read this,
but--" He touched the brown envelope, concluded lamely, "it--it's a
manuscript--"

Well, that's one of the headaches of being a story-teller. Strange
things creep out of the cracks and crevices--most of them bringing with
them the Great American Novel. It was spring in Roanoke, and spring
fever had claimed me as a victim. I didn't feel like working, anyway.
No, not even in my garden. Especially in the turnip patch. Hank Cleaver
isn't the only guy who has trouble with his turnips.

I sighed and led the way into my work-room. I said, "Okay, friend.
Let's have a look at the masterpiece...."

His first words, after we had settled into comfortable chairs, made
me feel like a dope. I suppose I'm a sort of stuffed shirt, anyway,
suffering from a bad case of expansion of the hatband. And I'd been
treating my visitor as if he were some peculiar type of bipedal worm.
It took all the wind out of my sails when he said, by way of preamble,
"If I may introduce myself, Mr. Clinton, I'm Dr. Edgar Winslow of the
Psychology Department of--"

He mentioned one of our oldest and most influential Southern
universities. I said, "Omigawd!" and broke into an orgy of apologies.
But he didn't seem to be listening to me; he was preoccupied with his
own explanation.

"I came to you," he said, "because I understand you write stories
of--er--pseudo-science?"

I winced.

"Science-_fiction_," I corrected him. "There's quite a difference, you
know."

"Is there?" He frowned. "Oh, yes. I see. Please forgive me. Well,
Clinton--" The professorial stamp was upon him; quite unconsciously he
addressed me as if I were one of his students. "Well, Clinton, I came
to ask a favor of you. I want you to transmit a message to a certain
man. I want you to write the message in such a form that it will not be
lost--in the form of a fictional narrative."

It takes all kinds to make a world. I gazed at him thoughtfully. I
said, "Don't look now, but isn't that doing it the hard way? I'll be
glad to help you out. But putting a simple message into story form
is--well, why not just let me _tell_ the guy? By word of mouth?"

"I'm afraid," he said soberly, "that is impossible. You see, the person
to whom this message must go will not be born until the year 1942."

"Nineteen--!" It worked. It threw me off balance for a minute. Then
came the dawn. It _was_ a gag, after all. My pal Ross being funny
from out Chicago way, maybe? Or Palmer, deserting Tark long enough to
joyride me over the well-known hurdles? I chuckled. I said, "That's all
right, Professor. I'm young; I can wait. Just tell me the name of this
unsprouted seedling, and I'll stick around till he gets old enough to
talk to. Only the good die young; I expect to live to a ripe old age."

He glanced at me slowly, and a bit sadly, I thought. "I'm sorry,
Clinton," he said, "but that won't do. It won't do at all. It will have
to be written. You see--you won't be here then...."

       *       *       *       *       *

You know, it should have been funny. Uproariously, screamingly funny.
I should have laughed my crazy head off, given my obviously screwy
visitor a smoke and a drink and a clap on the back and said, "Okay,
pal. You win the marbles. Come clean, now. Who put you up to this
crystal ball stuff? What's the payoff?"

But I didn't, because somehow it wasn't funny after all. There was a
deadly seriousness to my visitor's manner; the knuckles of his hands
were white upon his knees, his icy blue eyes burned with a tortured
regret that was like a dash of water to my mirth.

"I'm sorry, Clinton," he said. "I'm really dreadfully sorry."

I lit a cigarette carefully. In as even a voice as I could muster, I
said, "Perhaps you'd like to tell me more? Perhaps you'd better start
from the beginning?"

"Yes," he said. "Yes, I think that would be best." He fingered the
thick brown envelope nervously. "The story begins," he said, "and
ends--with this manuscript...."

       *       *       *       *       *

"As I have already told you," said Dr. Winslow, "my profession is
teaching. Psychology is my field. Recently I have given much of my
time to research into the lesser-known faculties of the human mind.
Experimental psychical research such as that investigated by Prof. J.
B. Rhine of Duke. You are undoubtedly familiar with his work?"

"Extra-sensory perception?" I nodded. "Yes. Most fascinating.
The results are far from satisfactory, though. And some of his
conclusions--"

"You make a common error," said my visitor gravely. "Dr. Rhine has not
assumed to draw any conclusions--as yet. He offers only a few, and
completely logical, presumptions.

"Dr. Rhine's studies to date, however, have been in the field of
extra-sensory perception only. There are other fields of psychical
research quite as untouched, and, I have reason to believe, even more
important and--fruitful.

"It is in one of these companion fields that I have been laboring. I
have been investigating the phenomenon you may know as 'telaesthesia.'"

"You mean," I asked, "telepathy?"

"There is a difference between the two. Telepathy, as defined by Myers
in 1882, is 'the communication of impressions of any kind from one mind
to another, independently of the recognized channels of sense.' It
implies a deliberate, recognized contact between two minds existent at
one time.

"Telaesthesia is a more complex meeting of entities. If A, let us
say, reaches out and helps himself to the contents of B's mind
_without_ the knowledge or assistance of B, that process will be
called 'telaesthesia.' Unlike telepathy, it knows no barriers of Time.
There are hundreds of recorded case histories from which we learn of
men of our time who have established telaesthetic contact with former
forgotten eras.

"And of days to come, as well!" Here Winslow's eyes literally gripped
me. "But never, until now, has anyone succeeded in gaining more than a
fleeting glimpse into the Time stream of the future. Never before has
a man established a contact so deep, so strong, that he could read not
one sentence or one paragraph of that which is to be--but an entire
chapter, decades long...!"

       *       *       *       *       *

It was spring in Roanoke. Outside, warm April sunshine poured down
luxuriant gold upon the faint, green buds. My place, _Sans Sou_, lies
in a quiet fold between two rolling hills. There was nothing to disturb
that quiet now save the boastful warble of a redbird, "Purty! Purty!"
and the petulant complaint of a chipmunk in the sycamore.

The sky was a pale, soft blue, cloudless and serene. There were no
clouds, and even the delicate fronds of the weeping willow drooped
motionless. So it could not have been a storm I heard. Yet as he spoke,
a dark shadow seemed to scud across the sky, veiling the sunlight, and
the gods made portent in the swell of distant thunder. I felt the short
hairs stiffen on my neck, and despite the warmth I shivered.

I said, and why I spoke in a whisper I cannot tell, "Never before ...
until ... _now_?"

"Until now!" he repeated. And suddenly his fingers were swift with
eagerness, he fumbled with the flap of the envelope while words
raced from his lips. "Several months ago I began to experiment with
automatic writing, one of the means by which telaesthetic contact is
authenticated.

"At first the results were--as might be expected--faulty. From the
autohypnotic syncopes into which I was able to project myself, I woke
to find nothing on the sheets before me but meaningless scribbles.

"And then, suddenly, I woke one day to find that in my period of
subliminal usurpation I had achieved a definite result. I--or
someone--had written four full pages. The first four pages of this
manuscript!"

Here he handed the manuscript to me. I had time to notice that the
writing was full-bodied, flowing. Then Dr. Winslow's words claimed my
attention again.

"That was but the beginning. Once having established contact, it was
as though I became the _alter ego_ of this mysterious correspondent.
From that time on my experiments were graced with success. Whenever I
resumed contact, pages were added to the manuscript. By the periodicity
of these, I am led to believe that Brian O'Shea is a diarist, and that
through some inexplicable phenomenon, it is given to me to be able to
set down, telaesthetically, the very words he writes in his diary--"

"You said," I interrupted, "Brian--?"

"O'Shea," nodded Winslow. "Brian O'Shea. A soldier in the army of the
Americas, Clinton--in the year 1963 A.D.! His diary is a history of the
things to come!"

       *       *       *       *       *

What I would have said then, I do not know. Maybe I would have said
something bitingly scurrilous--which I most certainly would have
regretted later. Or perhaps, as is most likely, I was momentarily
stunned into speechlessness. But I was spared the necessity of
speaking. Dr. Winslow had risen; eyes glowing strangely, he touched my
shoulder.

"I am going to leave you now, so you may read this manuscript in peace.
When you have finished, you will understand why I came, and know that
which must be done.

"You will find that the manuscript begins abruptly at the moment when
first I 'contacted' O'Shea. It ends with equal abruptness. There
are fragments missing; these may be filled in or rounded out as you
consider necessary for the purpose of story-telling. I have made a few
slight changes in spelling. Whether O'Shea was--or should I say 'will
be?'--a poor scholar, I do not know. The spelling of some words may
have changed over a period of trouble-swept decades....

"But whatever surprises lie in store for you, whatever conclusions
you draw from the manuscript you are about to read, I beg of you that
you play the game of caution. If you end by doubting O'Shea's story,
_still_ you must convey to him the message the manuscript demands. It
is the only way. We must take no chances. I will leave my address--"
Here he scribbled a few words on his card; I noted subconsciously that
his own handwriting was tiny, crabbed, angular. "When you have finished
reading, get in touch with me. No, don't get up!"

For a long moment I stared after him. Is there any way I can tell you
how I felt? I, who have written fantasies woven of thin air, now thus
to be suddenly thrust into a fantasy beyond my own wildest imaginings?
Even more important, is there a way I can make you believe that this is
not merely another amusing tale, to be read today and forgotten soon?

The structure of this narrative is mine. I supplied the story form. But
is there any way I can convince you that the words which follow are not
my own? _I did not write this story!_ It is the story of a man who is
not yet born, who will not live these happenings for twenty years.

Here is the story of Brian O'Shea, soldier....


                                  II

--Stumbled and pitched to his knees. I ran to his side and would have
carried him, but he shook me off.

"It's too late, O'Shea," he said. "My number's up. Take over. And--" He
hiccoughed convulsively and his lips drooled red. "And for Lord's sake,
Brian, get the men out of this trap!"

His eyes glazed, then, and his head dropped forward to his chest.
Someone tugged at my shoulder. It was Ronnie St. Cloud; he was
screaming, above the splatter of shrapnel, "The hills, O'Shea! They've
cut us off from the river. The hills are our only way out!"

Danny Wilson was beside him, and Knudsen, and a few more. About us
milled a shrieking, terrified throng; it was impossible to tell soldier
from civilian. Our uniforms were anything but uniform. We wore whatever
serviceable garments we could salvage. I still had--though I suppose
it was unrecognizable beneath a layer of caked sweat and mud--an old
khaki campaign shirt, but my breeches were a corduroy pair I had found
in a demolished farm house near Sistersville. St. Cloud wore the
horizon-blue jacket of a _poilu_ beside whom he had fought in Belgium.
Knudsen looked least military of all in whipcord riding breeches
commandeered from the tack rooms of the Greenbriar Inn at White Sulphur.

St. Cloud was right, of course; we might have known from the beginning
we couldn't hold Huntington. It was open to the west, and that entire
sector, from Chicago to Detroit and spearheading southward to Akron,
Cincinnati, Zanesville, was occupied by von Schuler's Death's Head
Brigade.

But Captain Elmon, who had whipped our tiny company into some semblance
of order after the debacle at Pittsburgh and had brought us safely down
the river through Parkersburg and Gallipolis, had believed we might be
able to defend this West Virginia river town until reinforcements could
reach us from the Fort Knox garrison.

       *       *       *       *       *

There was a school here, a Marshall College, with a layout ideal
for our purposes. The buildings were more than a hundred years old,
sturdily built; there were dormitories, kitchens, private power plants
for heat and light. The campus was encircled by a waist-high brick wall
which, sandbagged, made a perfect first-line defense against infantry.

The rugged, mountainous terrain made it impossible for the Toties to
bring up mechanized units. Nor could they bring pressure to bear from
the Ohio River which, here, was not only shallow but bedded with
rubble from the locks and dams we had blown up.

But--the old, old story. They got us from the air. Their Messerschmitts
and Junkers descended on us like a host of locusts, bombed the town
ruthlessly; small pursuit planes strafed the fleeing populace with
merciless persistence. We couldn't do anything about that, of course.
Captain Elmon told me once--he saw volunteer service in Sweden before
our country got into it--that in the early days of the war, aircraft
confined its operations to military objectives. But I laughed; I knew
he was just leading me on. He was a great one for joking, was the
captain, even in the darkest hour.

Now Elmon lay dead at my feet; his final command had been that I take
over. Get the men out of this trap. There was no time to waste in
bootless grieving. Already the sharp bite of sidearms augmented the
scream of shellfire ... which meant the Toties were up to their old
trick of parachuting an army of occupation into the beleaguered town.

I shouted swift orders to the others, bade them pass the word around to
"take to the hills." There were viaducts under the railroad at 16th and
20th Streets; we used these as our ports of egress. It wasn't a matter
of minutes. We gave ground slowly, fighting off the enemy advance from
street to street, alley to alley, house to house.

By the old football stadium, now an ammunition dump, I found Bruce
MacGregor, the Canadian, and the roly-poly Hollander, Rudy Van Huys.
They had impressed the services of a dozen scared civilians, were
loading trucks, vans, anything with our meager store of ammunition.
MacGregor glanced at me sharply.

"Where's the Old Man, O'Shea?"

"Dead," I told him. "We're on our own. Mac, do you think you can handle
this job alone?"

"Why?"

"I want Van Huys to forage. We're retreating to the hills. Use the 20th
Street underpass, cut south to the Big Sandy, then west at Louisa.
Rudy, get all the food-stuffs you can lay hands on. We're heading for
hungry country."

They grunted understanding and I went on. They were two good men.
The chubby Dutchman could smell out provisions like a beagle. Our men
wouldn't starve immediately, anyway.

That moment's delay was the only thing that saved my life. I was but
a half block away from the underpass when a Totie bomber spotted the
stream of refugees flooding out of the city through that viaduct. My
ears sang to the screaming whine of his power dive, concussion threw
me to the pavement as he loosed his entire rack full of bombs into the
heart of the fleeing throng.

They never had a chance. Those who did not die instantly in the
explosion were buried a split-second later in the tons of twisted steel
and concrete that cascaded down upon them. There was one moment of
dreadful cacaphony, hoarse screams of fear mingling with the thunderous
roar of the explosion--then a dull, unearthly silence, punctuated only
by the muted whimper of a few charred bodies that could not die and the
grating slither of broken masonry filling the chinks of the funereal
mound.

       *       *       *       *       *

I rose, shaken, nauseated. Others had come up behind me; among them was
Devereaux. There were tears in the young Frenchman's eyes. He lifted
his head blindly toward the sky, shook an impotent fist.

"_Les sales cochons!_ Will it never end, O'Shea, the triumph of these
devils? Are honor and mercy dead? Is God dead? My country ... all of
Europe ... now yours...."

"They haven't taken America," I told him savagely, "yet! Come on. We're
leaving town through the 20th Street viaduct. Is that you, Ronnie?
What's the news?"

"They've consolidated position along Fifth Avenue, thrown a defense
line from Four Pole Creek to the river, infantry advancing north along
the river bank to the college. Thompson and a foray squad are trapped
in the First National, no use trying to save them. We blew the Toties'
brains out, though." St. Cloud grinned ghoulishly. "We had City Hall
plaza groundmined. They chose that spot to set up general headquarters."

"Where's Frazier?"

"Dead. Blue Cross."

"Janowsky?"

"Same thing."

"Wilson?"

"He's all right. Or was. He went back toward the college. Said
something about having an ace up his sleeve, whatever that means."

I didn't tell him. I didn't have to, for at that moment Danny came
racing toward us. He waved his hand at me in a sort of vague salute or
greeting, yelled, "If you're ready to get goin', _git_! There'll never
be a better time."

"Why?"

"Because the Toties are goin' to have their hands full in a minute.
With something too hot to handle. I just happened to remember that
college we were bunked in had its own heating plant. A natural gas
pipe-line. Since it was the Toties' objective, I thought maybe I'd warm
house before they got there. Hold your hats, folks! There she goes!"

There came a sudden, terrific blast of sound. Even at that distance
we felt the shuddering repercussion, felt a breath of superheated air
fan our cheeks as the natural well Danny had set off let go with a
thunderous detonation. Into the gathering dusk shot a writhing spiral
of white-hot flame ... the jagged outlines of oft-bombed houses looked
black and ugly against the searing screen.

The flames leaped higher, higher, spread. An oily pall blotted the
dying rays of the sun; from afar came to us the crackling agony of a
city destroying itself. I watched, spellbound for a moment, then turned
to the others.

"Danny is right. This is our chance. Let's go!"

       *       *       *       *       *

MacCregor and Rudy Van Huys were waiting for us in the hills beyond
the city. We paused to take stock of equipment, count noses, and
plan our next move. Of our company--which had numbered six hundred
before Pittsburgh, and had been one hundred and sixty-odd at yesterday
evening's rollcall--now there remained but fifty-seven men. Twelve
recruits joined us from the clamoring mob of civilian refugees. These
were, of course, either graybeards, striplings, or men of dubious value
as soldiers. All men of fighting age and caliber had long ago been
called to the colors by wave upon wave of government drafts.

We were a pitiful collection, poorly fed, inadequately armed, raggedly
clad. Even so, the civilians were loud in their demand that we remain
with them to "protect" them. But this I could not agree to do.

"You'll be safer," I told them, "hiding here in the hills than marching
with us. We'll try to contact Preston's brigade at Fort Knox. You have
food, water, radios, medical supplies. Hide out, keep living and--keep
hoping!"

And so we left them. They must have numbered three thousand, mostly
women and children. A few tried to follow, but I quickened the pace.
The last weeping woman abandoned the pursuit after five miles; I saw
her fall to earth, beating the insensate soil with weary, hopeless
fists.

Beside me marched Danny Wilson. He was a reckless, devil-may-care
lad, was Danny. Even in the thick of battle his ruddy features were
habitually wreathed in a grin. But it had deserted him now. He said
soberly, "Maybe we should have stayed with them, Brian, boy. It's a
hard row to hoe."

"We can't fight a war in small detachments," I told him grimly. "You
know that. Mexico tried it, and now their country is under Totie rule.
Nova Scotia tried it, and now the swastika flies there. Our only hope
is to concentrate, meet them somewhere in one decisive battle."

"I suppose you're right. We go to join Preston?"

"Yes. It's the general concentration point. Elmon got instructions
by radio just before he went west. Jackson is bringing up his army
from the Gulf, Davies is marching in from Springfield. They say
three flights are taking off from Fort Sill; we'll have a small air
force. If we can beat the Toties off at Louisville, we'll cut their
communications line from Pittsburgh to Cincinnati, hold the Ohio."

That night we slept along the Big Sandy. Before we bivouacked I broke
our little company into six squads, each of eleven men, each headed by
a veteran on whom I knew I could depend. I appointed Danny Wilson and
Ronnie St. Cloud as my lieutenants. In arranging the squads, I tried to
place the men according to nationality under one of their own race.

Raoul Devereaux led one of the French squads, while Anatole LeBrun
the other. That would have been funny a few years ago, when the army
was still organized under the caste basis, because Devereaux used to
be a captain and LeBrun a common private. But that old "officer and
gentleman by Act of Congress" stuff had gone overboard a long time ago.
Now we picked our leaders by their leadership ability.

Ian Pelham-Jones, the Britisher, and Bruce MacGregor headed two
English-speaking squads; Rudy Van Huys commanded a group of Dutch and
Belgians; the tall Norwegian, Ingolf Knudsen, led a collection of
assorted Scandinavians. Norwegians, Swedes, Finns, Danes--Lord, there
was a tough outfit!

And so we hit the trail. There's not much use telling about the days
that followed. We marched and slept and ate and marched again. We were
spotted once by a Totie spyplane; he came down to do a little plain and
fancy strafing but we had the advantage of broken terrain. We took to
cover and turned his crate into a colander before he decided he'd had
enough. Lars Frynge, the Swedish sharpshooter, claims he punctured the
pilot as well as the plane, but I wouldn't know about that. Though it's
true that he did wobble as he flew away.

       *       *       *       *       *

We avoided Lexington, cutting south through Campton and Irvine. We
picked up a railroad at Lancaster. Joe Sanders, a native of these
parts, said it was a part of the old Louisville & Nashville. If it
were in operation, he said, it would take us right to our destination.
But that was like saying if we had wings we could fly. The rails were
twisted ribbons of steel; in some places the roadbed had been so
completely eradicated you would never know it had been there.

We saw people from time to time, but mostly in the small towns. They
came out to cheer us as we marched through, offered us what little they
had in the way of fresh water, barley bread, clothing that would never
be used, now, by sons, husbands, brothers, who had fought their final
battle. I got a fine new sweater in one village. In another we had an
odd experience. A white-haired granddame insisted we accept a flag she
had sewn for us. A funny-looking red flag with blue diagonal cross-bars
and thirteen white stars. We used it later to bury Johnny Grant. He
died of a delayed gas hemorrhage.

The larger towns were deserted. We saw only one man in Danville. A
scrawny, long-haired weasel skulking through the ruins of what had once
been an A & P supermarket. Bruce MacGregor took a shot at him, but I
knocked his rifle up. The bullet whistled over the man's head, and he
scurried away like a sick, desperate rabbit. I knew there was a G.O.
to shoot all looters on sight, but the time had passed, I told Mac, to
concern ourselves with such trivialities. Ammunition was too precious.

And, anyway, if he didn't find the buried provisions, maybe the enemy
would.

The seventh night out, we camped in the woods north of Bardstown, just
a few yards off what had once been a main highway. I was beginning
to smell smoke. Tomorrow we would join the main garrison, get fresh
clothing and equipment and be assigned our duties in the projected
offensive. That is, I suppose, why I was sleepless.

We had stumbled across a deserted tobacco shed the day before. The
brown leaves were old, parched, crumbling, but it was better than the
hay-and-alfalfa mixture they had given us up North. I rolled myself a
cigarette and was sitting by the side of the road when suddenly I heard
it. The sound of an approaching automobile.

A moment later moonlight glinted on metal; I saw it picking its slow,
lightless way over the cracked asphalt. My heart leaped. This must be
a car from Louisville. I ran down to the road, stood waiting eagerly.
It approached at a snail's pace, but in the gloom the driver must have
had all he could do to watch the road without keeping an eye peeled for
vagabond troops, for when, as it came beside me, I cried a greeting
and reached for the door, there came a startled sound from within, the
motor roared stridently, and the car leaped forward, almost wrenching
my arm from its socket.

Somehow I managed to hold on, though the automobile bounced and jarred
crazily as it struck deep ruts in the roadbed. My head glanced metal
and I saw whirling stars. "Hey!" I yelled. "What the almighty hell are
you trying to do! Take it easy!"

Brakes squealed; the car jolted to a stop. And from the interior a
voice, high-pitched with relief, cried:

"You--you're an American! Thank Heaven!"

Then a slim form collapsed suddenly over the wheel. I yanked the door
open, dragging the unconscious driver from the cab. He must be, I
thought, wounded. He must be--

But it wasn't a "he" at all. As the body fell back limply over my arm,
a campaign hat tumbled earthward. Soft brown hair cascaded from beneath
it. The driver was a girl!

I had ammonia tubes in my first-aid kit. I snapped one beneath her
nose, jolted her back to awareness. And she proved her femininity by
coming out of it with a question on her lips.

"Who--who are you?"

"O'Shea," I said, "commanding a detachment from the Army of the Upper
Ohio. Marching to join Preston's brigade at Louisville. But never mind
that. Who are _you_? Where do you think you're going?"

She said, "Louisville!" In the darkness her face was a white blur,
drab, expressionless, but there was a touch of hysteria to her voice.
"Louisville! But haven't you got a radio? Didn't you know--"

We hadn't. It didn't make sense. As she faltered, I snapped, "Know
what? Go on!"

"Louisville has fallen. The Toties have taken Fort Knox. Our troops are
destroyed, the government has fled, and the Army of the Democracies is
in utter rout!"

I stared at her numbly. In the black of the woods a nightjar screamed a
single, discordant taunt....


                                  III

The commotion had roused most of the others. Quiet forms in the
midnight, they had drifted to the road. Wilson spoke now. He said,
"That's the end, then. If she's right, Brian, the war is over. And
we've lost."

I said to the girl, "How about it?"

She shook her head.

"I'm afraid so. The last reports I heard, they had seized the
Mississippi, cut all contact between our Eastern and Western armies.
The Japs control California and Nevada. There was a terrific battle
being waged at Albuquerque. The Russian navy holds the Great Lakes.
Everywhere you hear the same story."

Pelham-Jones demanded harshly, "St. Louis? Did you hear anything
about--?"

"Wiped out to a man. It was caught in a vise. The Germans from the
east, the Italians from the north."

Pelham-Jones said, "I see," quietly. He turned away. His shoulders
looked heavy. He had a younger brother at St. Louis. Van Huys looked at
the girl suspiciously.

"How do we know she's telling the truth, O'Shea? It may be more lies.
She may be a Totie spy."

I said, "You have your dent?"

She nodded and handed it to me. I flashed my light on it. It was
authentic, all right. The picture on the tiny metal identification tag
was an image of her; the name beneath was _Maureen Joyce_. She was
tagged as a WAIF, a member of the Women's Auxiliary Intelligence Force.
I gave it back to her.

"Very good, Miss Joyce. Sorry. We can't afford to take chances,
though. You understand, I'm sure. But--" My curiosity made me exceed
my authority. "But what are you doing here? Surely you wouldn't be
attempting to escape the Toties in this direction? If they hold the
east?"

She hesitated for a moment. Then, carefully, "I am acting under orders,
Captain O'Shea. They were supposed to be _secret_ orders. But in view
of what has happened--" She made up her mind. "It would be better for
more than one to know. In case--in case anything should happen to me.

"You've heard of Dr. Mallory?"

"Thomas Mallory?" I said. "The physicist? The one who pestered the
daylights out of the government about some crack-brained invention
during the early days of the war? Is he the one you mean?"

"Yes. The government isn't too sure, now, that it acted wisely in
refusing to listen to his plan. But you know how it was for a while.
Miracle men flooded the War Department with fantastic ideas for
'smashing the enemy.'

"Only, in this last extremity, the War Department decided to
investigate Mallory's claim. As a last resort. I was commissioned to
find him, bring him to Louisville. But now--" Uncertainly. "Now I don't
know just what I ought to do. Even if he has a plan, and a good one,
there is no one to whom we can communicate it."

       *       *       *       *       *

Surprisingly, it was Danny Wilson who interrupted.

"Except," he said suddenly, "us!" He turned to me. "Brian, it would be
suicide for us to go on to Louisville--and there's no place else to go.
We might as well make this our job. We have everything to gain, nothing
to lose."

"Do you," I asked the girl, "know where Mallory is?"

"Only roughly. Somewhere in the hills of the upper Cumberland. I plan
to comb the neighborhood--"

The Kentuckian, Joe Sanders, edged forward.

"Don't need to do no combin'," he drawled. "Reckon I c'n help. This
yere Mall'ry--he a big man? White hair? Red complected?"

"Why--why, yes. I believe so."

"Mmm. Figgered it'd be the same one. I know him. Usta fish near his
place when I was a colt. He come there in the summertime, big house in
Cleft Canyon on Mount Rydell. I 'member we usta call him the 'devil
Doc,' 'count of there was alluz queer goin's-on at his place. Well,
Cap'n?"

He squinted at me. I weighed the chances briefly. It was probably a
wild goose chase. On the other hand, it was useless, as Danny had
pointed out, to throw our little force against the might of the Toties
who now held Fort Knox. And there was a faint, insane possibility that
Dr. Mallory had a 'plan'--an invention, maybe--that would enable us
to form the nucleus of a new army that, reorganized, would sweep the
invaders from our land....

"We'll do it!" I said. "We'll march at dawn!"

We had to leave the car there on the road and strike out across
country. It was the shortest and safest way to Cleft Canyon. Now that
the Toties had made a clean sweep of the East, the roads were no longer
open to us. As in Mexico five years ago, as in Ontario, the Maritimes,
the New England States year before last, as in Illinois last year,
floods of Totie scavengers were pouring through the conquered land in a
series of "mop up" operations.

Time and again aircraft droning over our heads sent us scurrying to
cover. Once a flight surprised us in an open field. That's when we lost
Johnny Grant and three other men. Nearby woods saved the rest of us.

Before we abandoned the car, I had the men strip it of everything we
could possibly use. Upholstery, tires, all electrical accessories,
including the televise. It was this last that kept us going, kept our
spirits aflame with determination, even when the trail was hardest.
Wherever we spun the dial we found the ether crackling with the boasts
of the enemy; each scene pictured on the plate was one calculated to
tighten the already grim jaws of my men.

The Totie banner floated everywhere. It was a blood-red flag; in the
center was a quartered circle. In each of these segments was a symbol
of one of the four totalitarian states that had welded to form the
Totie army. Swastika and crimson sun, side by side with the Italian
fasces and Soviet hammer-and-sickle. The Big Four that, irresistibly
combined, had ground the principles of democracy under foot.

It made me bitter, but it made me heart-sick, too. I could not help
wondering how, or why, my father and those of his generation had been
so blind as not to see the shadow of the inevitable creeping toward
them.

Surely they must have known, as early as 1940, that Sweden would not be
the last neutral to be drawn into the conflict? Even then there must
have been rumblings in the Balkans, on the Mediterranean? Did they not
guess that Italy and Russia were just waiting until the hour was ripe,
that Japan's leisurely conquest of China was a mere military exercise
to keep Nippon warmed up until the day should arrive for a blow at the
Pacific Islands?

My own country was perhaps the worst offender. Had it not been told
by a wise man, centuries before that, "In Union there is Strength?"
Yet America, like Switzerland and Portugal, Greece and Egypt, played
ostrich. Hoping against all sane hope that each succeeding conquest
would so weaken the Toties that the few actively fighting democracies
could win out in the end.

I remember, as a child, the gleeful shouting in the streets of
America when news reached us across the Atlantic that Hitler had been
assassinated. I remember my father saying to a neighbor, "That's the
last of the mad dogs. Stalin and Mussolini are gone; now Hitler.
There'll be an armistice within a month. After that--"

I wonder if Dad ever thought of that when he fought with his regiment
at Buffalo. The true facts must have come to him as a series of
staggering blows. The sudden collapse of the Franco-British union when
Russia and Italy, selecting their moment with diabolic accuracy of
timing, threw their support to Germany. The three mad dogs were dead,
yes, but four younger, madder dogs took their place. Himmler, Ciano,
Molotov, and Kashatuku. The crushing of India, the rape of Africa, the
shadow of the crimson banner stretching across the Atlantic Ocean to
touch Brazil.

It was too late then to evoke the Monroe Doctrine. Too late to throw
defenses about our own shore line. Canada owned but a shell of its
former man power, Mexico was a hotbed of Totie sympathizers. Our
militia was unready, theirs fired for twelve years in the flaming
crucible of war.

These were not pleasant memories I had as our small band marched
toward Mallory's hide-out in the hills. But I could not escape them.
I, myself, had witnessed the siege of New York, had seen Philadelphia
blown to shards by the mighty Armada that swept up the Delaware, had
heard the last, defiant cry of the defenders of Los Angeles--

       *       *       *       *       *

_Unfortunately, here a portion of the manuscript is missing. To Brian
O'Shea the events mentioned must have been so commonly known as to
render unnecessary the mentioning of specific dates. Dr. Winslow places
the probable date of the invasion of the United States at 1959, but
this may vary as much as two years, one way or the other._

"--low!" warned Sanders. "I don't think he's seen us!"

Danny's eyes had widened; he was pointing eastward.

"He's not looking for us! There's what he's waiting for. Look! An
American plane!"

I was soaked to the skin, cold and miserable. The damned Totie scout
might, I found myself thinking unreasonably, have waited just five more
minutes before sneaking up over the horizon. Five more minutes and
we would have finished fording this stream, would be up the rise and
through the tangle of elm that Joe Sanders claimed concealed the place
that was our destination.

Beside me, Maureen sneezed. The poor kid was wet, bedraggled. I
don't know how she contrived to still appear beautiful under such
circumstances. Somewhere behind me, I heard the snick of a breech-bolt.
I turned in time to find LeBrun raising his rifle. I slapped it down.

"No, you idiot!"

He looked sulky.

"He's low, O'Shea. I can lay one in his gas tank."

"And if you miss," I hissed, "you'll have the whole damned Totie army
down around our ears. We've come this far without being caught. We'll
take no risks now."

Still, I knew how he felt. It was rotten to crouch there, knee-deep in
icy mountain water, concealed by a vault of foliage, watching one of
our planes--one of what must be a very, very few of our planes--drive
blindly into the path of a hedge-hopping Totie fighter that had spotted
its prey and was now waiting for it.

Then, suddenly, there was the roar of motors. The American plane had
come within range. The Totie plane broke from concealment, spun skyward
in a swift, dizzying burst of motion. White puffs broke from its nose
seconds before our ears caught the spiteful chatter of machine-gun fire.

It caught the American flyer off guard. Something broke from his left
wing, flapped crazily in the wind, as he jammed his plane--more by
instinct than anything else--into a dive. The Totie was on his tail
in an instant. And we stood there, helpless, watching a sweet, if
one-sided, air battle.

The Totie plane was superior, of course. But our pilot was a master.
Time and again he wriggled out from under the other's nose just as it
seemed he would be riddled into fragments. Once he managed to climb
high enough to try a few shots of his own, but the Totie Immelmanned,
was back on his tail before he could even get his sights trained.

It ended as suddenly as it had begun. One minute they were spiraling
for position, whirling around each other like a pair of strange,
snarling dogs. The next there came a thin streamer of smoke from the
tail of the American plane; a streamer that thickened to a cloud as we
watched, became flame-shot black, choking, menacing.

The Totie fired a final burst into the damaged plane. It went into a
spin. Something dark appeared from a gap over the fuselage, it was
the pilot climbing free. For what seemed an endless moment he poised
there, then he was a brown chip on the blue breast of the sky, a chip
that hurtled headlong to earth. Beside me Maureen gasped; I felt her
shoulder tense against mine.

Then a white mushroom blossomed suddenly; I choked a word of profanity
that somehow I didn't mean to be profane. The parachute, bloated with
air, zigzagged languidly to the ground. The pilot was halfway down when
his plane crashed. Flames leaped in a wooded thicket across the rise.
The Totie airman circled several times. Then, apparently content, he
gunned his ship, disappeared northward.

MacGregor frowned. "They must be confident. First Totie I ever saw who
didn't gun a parachuter."

       *       *       *       *       *

We left our hiding place, then; broke into the open where the
caterpillar could see us. He was a good flyer. He sighted us, played
his cords expertly, and landed less than an eighth of a mile from
where we had gathered. A couple of our men helped him fight down the
still-struggling 'chute; he kicked himself loose from the straps and
approached me.

"Won't have any more use for that," he said ruefully. "You're the
leader here? My name's Krassner. Jake Krassner. Fourth Aerial Combat."

I introduced him around. Danny Wilson said eagerly, "Did you say the
Fourth? I knew a guy flew with them. Name of Tommy Bryce. From Hoboken.
You know him?"

Krassner shook his head. He had hard, black eyes, a little close. Crisp
hair. Broad shoulders. He was a good-looking chap. A little haughty,
maybe. But airmen are like that, especially to ground-huggers.

"I'm sorry. Our personnel has changed a lot. Lately," he added grimly.
He looked at me. "I seem to have picked a hell of a place to get shot
down, Captain. What on earth are you doing in this desolate spot?"

Van Huys chuckled, and Joe Sanders grinned.

"Don't look like much from topside, eh, Krassner? I figgered it
wouldn't. The old man's a fox. He spent more than twenty years givin'
this hide-out the damnedest coat of natch'ral camouflage you ever seen."

"Old man?" said Krassner curiously. "Camouflage?"

Maureen touched my arm. She whispered, "Maybe you had better not tell
him, Brian. It's our secret--"

I started to tell her what the hell. He was one of us, and there were
mighty few of us left. We needed all the men we could get. And Krassner
looked like a man. I didn't get a chance to say any of this, though.
For as we talked, we had continued to follow Sanders. Joe was now
picking his way confidently through an opening in the tangle of foliage.

Sunlight dimmed as we entered a huge, cleared space entirely roofed by
an interwoven network of boughs. In this space was a wide, rambling,
one-story house, adjoined by a number of inexplicable sheds. And on the
veranda of the house stood a man I recognized instantly. It was Dr.
Thomas Mallory.


                                  IV

Mallory made us welcome. More than that, he seemed positively delighted
that we had come. He showed anxiety on only one point.

"No one saw you come here, Captain? You're sure of that?"

"Positive," I told him.

"Good!" He called, and assistants came from inside to lead my men
to quarters. I was surprised, as well as a little shocked and
disappointed, to discover the number of women attached to Dr. Mallory's
household. There were a few men, but for the most part he seemed to
have surrounded himself with girls. Not only that, but with young and
pretty girls!

But this was no time to sit in judgment on a man's morality. We had an
important mission. Maureen broached the subject as soon as we three
were rid of the others.

"You must know why we're here, Dr. Mallory. We did not find this place
by chance. We came because you are the last hope of our country. Too
late, the government realizes it needs the invention you offered it
five years ago."

Mallory shook his head sadly.

"I'm sorry, my child--"

"You can't refuse, Doctor!" I broke in. "Don't you understand? The
Toties overrun all the Americas. Democracy is dead unless--"

He raised a weary hand.

"Then democracy is dead, O'Shea. Not even I can restore its life. I
can say only one thing; I am glad from the bottom of my heart that the
government refused to listen to me when first I approached the War
Department with my plan."

"Glad? Why?"

"Because I was guilty of that which a scientist must ever dread. I
jumped to a hasty conclusion, based on insufficient evidence. My
conclusion was wrong, my plan--" He sighed, turned toward a door. "But
come. I will show you."

       *       *       *       *       *

He led the way from his office into an adjoining room; a laboratory,
spotless, white-gleaming. About the walls of the laboratory were a
number of cages. In some of these were small animals; I saw monkeys,
guinea pigs, a squirrel, rabbits. Some were active, eating, shuffling
about, looking at us with bright, inquisitive eyes. Others lay
apparently asleep.

But these I noticed with some remote part of my mind. For the focal
point of attention was a glass-walled case in the center of the room;
a topless case in which lay the body of a man. Maureen started. She
said, "Dead, Doctor?"

"He is not dead," replied Mallory somberly. "He is the result of my
dreadful error of judgment. These others--" He nodded toward the
cages. "--were the experiments that misled me. This man, one of my
assistants who trusted me and was daring enough to become my first
human experiment, sleeps. How long he will continue to sleep, I cannot
guess. But it may be for one, two, or even more decades!"

"Sleeps!" I said. But Maureen, with a flash of that swift intuition I
had seen before, guessed the answer. She said, "Anaesthesia! That was
your plan, Dr. Mallory!"

"Yes, my child. That was my plan. I am a scientist, but five years ago
I was sociologist enough to recognize that the United States could not
match the power of the Totalitarians. I realized, even then, that the
ending we have seen come to pass was inevitable. I set myself the task
of finding a way to meet the impending menace.

"I found the answer in a new form of anaesthetic. I will not tell you
its formula. It is a dismal failure--but that I did not know. I thought
it was a great success. When I permitted small animals--those you see
before you--to inhale some of the delicate granules--"

"Granules, Doctor?"

"Yes. It was a revolutionary means of inducing unconsciousness. When
I permitted the animals to inhale these granules, they fell into a
soft, deep, harmless slumber. I timed their periods of sleep carefully,
discovered the anaesthetic rendered them senseless over periods ranging
from one to two weeks.

"It was then, heady with success, I offered my plan to the government.
It was, I thought, so simple. Our planes would scatter the granules
over enemy terrain--" He laughed shortly, mirthlessly. "--and the enemy
would fall into deep slumber. While they were thus incapacitated, our
men, garbed in specially constructed suits, wearing protective masks,
could walk amongst them, disarm them, imprison them. The war would be
ended bloodlessly--"

I stared at him incredulously. I said, "But--but if it really works
that way, Dr. Mallory, that is the weapon we need!"

"Yes, my boy. But it doesn't work that way. I have told you I made an
error in judgment. I assumed that Man, being a higher animal than those
on which I experimented, would experience the same, or a slightly less
drastic reaction than that experienced by the animals. I did not take
into consideration the fact that Man is also a more highly integrated
animal. That he is weaker, in some respects.

"When Williamson, here, volunteered to become a human guinea pig, I
accepted his offer. I exposed him to the granules. He breathed deeply,
fell asleep--" Dr. Mallory shook his head. "And that was more than four
years ago. He still sleeps!"

       *       *       *       *       *

I said, "I understand now, Doctor, why you consider your plan a
failure. But you speak as a scientist and a humanitarian who would
shudder at seeing thousands of men sleep for a decade. I am a soldier.
I have met War face to face, and have learned, by bitter experience,
that there is no weapon too dreadful to use if the results are
satisfactory.

"What if your granules _do_ put the Toties to sleep for years instead
of days? Isn't that better than seeing our countrymen die beneath
the sword of the aggressor? Unless we act swiftly, this war is over.
Freedom, liberty, equality of men, all the things we believe in, are
doomed. But there is yet time to equip a few of our troops with the
suits and masks you speak of, turn loose your slumber-granules to the
winds.

"Even though thousands of our own men share the sleep of the enemy, we
can go through with the disarmament program you planned. When our foes
awaken, a decade hence, they will have lost their leaders and their
war. When our friends waken we will take them, triumphantly, to the
homes and cities we have rebuilt while they slumbered."

Dr. Mallory said, "I wish it were as simple as that, O'Shea. But
there is one other thing you do not know. The granules that are my
anaesthetic are more than mere granules. They are spores. Worse--they
are self-propagating spores!"

He pointed to a trebly barred and locked door opening on one wall of
the laboratory. For the first time there was nervousness in his voice.

"There is a storeroom beyond that door, O'Shea. In that storeroom,
quiescent in sterile containers, lie spores. Countless thousands,
millions of them. They are the granules I made for the government
before I discovered their real nature. There lies beyond that door a
weapon potent enough to end this war immediately--"

He paused suddenly. We had all heard it, the squeak of a worn hinge,
the shuffle of a footstep. I motioned Mallory to silence, tiptoed to
the office door and flung it open.

The aviator, Krassner, stood there. He was smiling. He said, "Ah, there
you are, Captain! I was looking for you. I wanted to ask if--"

"How long have you been here?" I asked angrily.

"How long? Why--just a minute or so. I--"

"Were you listening to our conversation?"

He stiffened; a flush highlighted his cheek bones.

"I beg your pardon, sir!" he said.

"Because, if you were--" Dr. Mallory was beside me, his hand was on my
arm. I hesitated. There was no sense in being so violently suspicious.
I said, "Well, never mind. Go back to your quarters, Krassner. I'll be
with you shortly."

"Very good, sir!" He saluted, turned and stalked from the office, a
picture of affronted honor and dignity. I felt somewhat ashamed of
myself.

Mallory said, "It really doesn't matter whether he heard us or not,
O'Shea. What I was about to say is, there lies beyond that door a
weapon potent enough to end the war immediately--but it must never be
used. For once loosed to the winds, those abominable spores would not
only end this war, they would still all animal life on the face of
Earth. I have said they were self-propagating. Each new generation of
spores would deepen the slumber into which mankind had been soothed by
the first--"

I said, "But why keep them, Doctor?"

"I don't quite know, O'Shea. Perhaps I have done so because I am, at
heart, more emotional than a true scientist should be. Perhaps I have
a secret fear that there may come a day when I shall be forced to play
God, give mankind its release from the chains of the tyrant."

Maureen shuddered.

"No, Doctor! You mustn't even think of that. Things look black now, but
they can't go on like this forever. Right and truth and liberty will
prevail in the end. There must be some other way to escape--"

"There is," said Dr. Mallory quietly. "There is another way. A plan I
have been working on ever since the failure of my first. There is one
last refuge to which they cannot follow us."

I said, "I don't understand, Doctor. Do you mean Antarctica?"

His grave eyes captured, held mine.

"No," he said. "A place more remote than even that. I mean, O'Shea--the
moon!"

       *       *       *       *       *

I knew, then, suddenly and with a great, overwhelming despair, that our
journey to Cleft Canyon had been a vain one. As a last resort we had
sought the hidden laboratory of one who had been a great scientist. We
had found a madman.

I said, "Maureen--" and I suppose there was regret in my voice.

But Mallory stopped me. "A moment, O'Shea. I'm not insane. Nor is my
plan--as you undoubtedly think--impossible. Did you ever hear the name
of Frazier Wrenn?"

The name was vaguely familiar, but I couldn't place it. Maureen could,
and did. She said, curiously, "Isn't he the traitor who disappeared
from Earth with a group of followers? Years ago? From a laboratory out
west somewhere?"

"Yes, my dear. In 1939. From Arizona. But whether he and his tiny band
were traitors is something future generations must decide. Wrenn hated
war; foresaw what must come of Earth's second Armageddon. He fled
Earth, his destination was the planet Venus, his purpose to maintain,
on that wild colony, a vestige of culture and civilization until
Earth's feverish self-destruction should end."

Mallory sighed. "We do not know what has become of Wrenn's expedition.
There has been no remotest sign, no signal--"

I said, "Venus! But, Doctor, that means _spaceflight_!"

"Yes, Brian. I was to have been a member of that gallant party. But I
was delayed in reaching their Arizona rendezvous, and their departure
was hastened by an unexpected attack. They left without me. But,
fortunately, Wrenn had confided in me the plans for his spaceship. For
years, now, with what scraps of metal I could steal from a war-ridden,
metal-hungry humanity, I have been secretly building a small duplicate
of the _Goddard_.

"You wonder where it is hidden? Our Kentucky hills conceal great
caverns, Brian. There is one beneath the hill on which this house
stands. Below us--as I will show you shortly--is a gigantic cave. In it
is my almost completed craft."

I had not noticed that Maureen's hand was in mine until I felt its soft
whiteness tense within my grasp. She cried, "But why the moon, Dr.
Mallory? Why not follow the Wrenn expedition--?"

"You ignore a major factor, my dear. Celestial mechanics. Wrenn's
flight was planned for a time when Venus and Earth were in conjunction.
Such is not the case now. Earth approaches the Sun, while Venus is at
aphelion. And my craft is, as I have said, but a small copy of Wrenn's.
Moreover, I have been able to collect only a small amount of fuel.

"There is only one body within our cruising range--Earth's moon. It is
my dream that we shall go there--"

I had been listening silently, stunned. Now I came to my senses.

"No, Doctor! I can listen to no more. You forget I am a soldier of the
United States army."

"The government has fallen; the last of the democracies is crushed
beneath the conqueror's heel, Brian, lad."

"It will rise again. In the hinterlands--"

"--are Totalitarian troops."

"There are still eighty million Americans--"

"And a hundred million aggressors!" He put a hand on my shoulder.
"Don't you see, Brian, this is how you can best serve your country?
Make this flight with me. We will take your men and my followers--two
score men and the women you have already seen--and form a colony on the
Moon.

"We will return, then, secretly, for more Americans. And more, and
more. We will transfer our democracy to a new soil, there grow in
strength and power and wisdom until some day we can reclaim our
heritage."

Despite my training, I could not help but be convinced. I said, shaken,
"But astronomers tell us the Moon is a barren, lifeless world?"

"For the most part, it is. But the Caltech telescope indicates that air
still lingers in the depths of the hollow craters. And in underground
caverns. Water can be synthesized. It will be no easy existence, but it
will be--"

"The ultimate salient!" breathed Maureen at my side. "The last line of
defense for freedom's children! Brian, Dr. Mallory is right! We must do
this thing!"

He looked at me hopefully. "Well, Brian O'Shea?"

I took a deep breath. "When does our flight depart?"


                                   V

At Dr. Mallory's suggestion, I did not tell my men too much about our
plans. "With so much at stake, O'Shea," he said, "the less they know
the better it will be."

But they did not ask to know much. They were good men; they trusted me.
And if they chafed a little at the enforced idleness of the next week,
the rest must have been a welcome surcease from months of fighting.
Only one man failed to share their calm acceptance of my orders.
Krassner. He told me, sulkily, "There's something going on around here,
O'Shea. And, damn it, I have a right to know what it is. As a fellow
officer--"

"I respect your brevet, Krassner," I told him somewhat curtly, "but for
the present I must ask you to remember that you are attached to this
division through courtesy only, and have no authority. In a few more
days, now, I will be at liberty to explain everything."

He had to be satisfied with that. Though it was the nature of the
man to be snoopy; several times he was observed prowling around the
grounds, searching some clue as to Doctor Mallory's well-concealed
secret.

He was chasing a will-o'-the-wisp, of course. A man might have searched
for months without finding the entrance to Mallory's underground
workshops. Mallory admitted Wilson and St. Cloud, my lieutenants, to
his confidence. He took us to the cavern wherein was being constructed
the spaceship.

The gateway to the depths was that which appeared to be a
photographer's dark-room. Once inside, Mallory pressed certain carved
ornaments, the entire farther wall slid back, and there stretched
before us a smooth, well-lighted passage leading downward at a gentle
incline.

We must have followed this more than a half mile before we debouched
into the main cavern; a mighty, vaulted chamber, a huge bubble of
emptiness blown in the solid mountain centuries ago when Earth was in
the travail of making.

But it was not this natural wonder that made me gasp. I had seen
others; I had, indeed, once taken refuge for four weeks with the Ninth
Artillery in Luray. That which brought an exclamation to my lips was
the shimmering monster braced on an exoskeleton of girders in the
middle of the chamber. A gigantic, tear-shaped rocketship, stern jets
lifted some feet off the ground, streamlined nose pointing at the roof
of the cave.

About it, in and around it, sweating men fretted, worried, labored,
like so many restless bees. Here the brief chatter of a riveting
machine woke snarling echoes as a final plate was welded into place;
there a master electrician wove an intricate network of wires into some
obscure purpose. In still another place, a strong-thewed gang trundled
seemingly endless trains of supplies into the ship's capacious holds.

Dr. Mallory smiled at the expressions on our faces, and there was
pardonable pride in his smile.

"There, my friends," he said quietly, "is the _Jefferson_."

"_Jefferson?_" repeated Maureen wonderingly.

"Named for him who, in our country's infancy, wrote down in blazing
words the principles on which all democracy is based. The inherent
right of men to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Once his words showed us the way. Now his name shall lead us to a new
civilization."

"Amen!" said Danny Wilson piously. Then, "Now can we have a look at
her? I mean _him_, Doctor?"

Knowing every nook and cranny, berth and hold, turret and gun-chamber
of the _Jefferson_ as I do now, it is hard to remember my feelings
on that day when first I strode her permalloy decks. Even so, I can
recall the vast wonder that engulfed me as Dr. Mallory led us through
the ship, pointing out the engines, the control-rooms, the Spartan
simplicity of the living quarters, the well-equipped kitchen and
compact storage bins. There was much I did not understand until long
afterward. Permalloy itself was a novelty to me. The metal had been
invented, Mallory said, by a German scientist. One of the old school. A
Doktor Eric von Adlund.

"I do not know what has become of him. Perhaps he, like the other
peace-loving great of his race, has long since been liquidated by the
Totalitarians."

       *       *       *       *       *

So said Dr. Mallory sadly. And he tried to explain the operation of the
small, inconceivably powerful, atomic motors, the invention of Frazier
Wrenn. It was a concept so novel, yet so simple, that it staggered
us all. But I could see how, without first having a knowledge of the
heretofore unknown element _inektron (the spelling of this important
word seems to have confused Brian O'Shea. In the manuscript it is
incomprehensibly scribbled. Dr. Winslow suggests the philological
similarity of such words as_ "inertron" _and_ "inactron"? _NSB_) man
might never have discovered the long-sought power of the atom.

St. Cloud, frankly at sea as regarded scientific matters, was delighted
with the military efficiency of the ship. I could see his fingers
yearning for the lanyard of one of the rotor-guns installed in the fore
and aft turrets. He liked, too, the foreman who came over to meet us.

"How many men have you working here below?" he asked.

Myers, the supervisor, told him twenty-three. "And there are twenty
women topside," he grinned. "Doc says we're going to a brutal frontier.
But if the women can stand it, we can. A man can do lots of impossible
things with his wife at his side."

I understood, then, the number of girls I had seen above ground, and
regretted my hasty judgment of Dr. Mallory's character. I might have
realized that he did nothing without purpose. He had seen--as I saw
now--that without something, some_one_, to fight for, the men of our
little colony-to-be could easily lose heart. He was assuring our
venture against all eventualities.

I was glad, suddenly, that Maureen was beside me. I wondered if she
felt the same way.

Danny Wilson voiced a problem that had puzzled me.

"But this cavern, Doctor? Aren't you like the man who, in his spare
time, built a yacht in his cellar? How are we ever going to get this
monster out of here?"

Mallory said placidly, "When the hour comes, we will burst from this
cavern like a moth from its chrysalis. You have not yet witnessed the
power of our atomic beams.

"One thrust of blinding energy from the forward jets and we will shear
an exit through the tons of solid rock and earth that now conceal us.
Before we leave--" He looked at me significantly. "--we will destroy
the buildings above ground. Including that one, sealed chamber that no
man must ever open.

"The Totalitarians will have no way of guessing who we were, what we
did here, or where we have gone. And even if they should guess, they
would be powerless to follow us."

His voice was low, vibrant, anticipatory.

"Your men and mine, Brian O'Shea, we hundred odd will establish the
first base on Luna. Then there will be other trips to Earth, gathering
more converts to our cause. The day will come when we will match our
conquerors in strength. And then--"

I said thoughtfully, "One more thing, Doctor. The _Jefferson_ is
supplied with water and provisions, yes. But if our number grows, we
will need our own farms and granaries. How are we to grow food in the
lightless grottoes of the moon?"

He nodded sagely.

"All that has been provided for, Brian, lad. I have overlooked nothing.
Chemical culture is possible. Trust me to take care of that problem
when it arises."

Danny Wilson coughed apologetically. He said, "We do, Doc. But--but
I think I know what's in the back of Brian's mind. Suppose something
should--I mean--if anything might happen to you--?"

"That, too, I have considered. There is a complete scientific library
in the aft turret. Science is no secret to the man who can read and
think."

Danny's face lighted. He said beautifully, "A library! Golly! Books!
I haven't seen a book for nigh onto fifteen years. Except Field Code
manuals. There hasn't been much time for reading lately."

"And that," said Mallory darkly, "is perhaps the greatest catastrophe
of this war. Reading men, thinking men, are happy men. They are not
concerned with the lust for conquest of anything save the unknown. Yes,
Wilson, there are books. And for those who seek light entertainment
there are even volumes of fiction. Magazines for amusement."

"Magazines?" I said, puzzled. "Magazines for amusement? I don't see
anything funny in an armament warehouse."

Mallory sighed.

"Forgive me, O'Shea. I had forgotten your youth. There was a time, when
you were a toddling child, when 'magazines' were not always ammunition
bins. Publishers used to issue monthly periodicals, printed on paper,
bound in bright jackets, filled with stories. Exciting adventures in
sports, the West, tales of crime and its detection, fictionized hazards
as to the future of the world--

"Ah, but that was long ago. That was when paper was cheap and common.
When the vast mills of Norway and Denmark and Canada poured endless
rolls of pulp into our country."

Danny said eagerly, "I'd like to see some of these here 'magazines,'
Doc. Could I?"

"You may. Myers will help you select some from the storage bin, Wilson.
And now, my friends, if you are ready to return to the surface--?"

       *       *       *       *       *

That, as I recall, was on the 29th day of July, 1963. Yes, I know
it was that day, because that was the date of the fall of Santa Fé.
We watched that battle through our televises; it was triumphantly
broadcast--a braggart deed in keeping with their boastful ways--by the
Toties.

Albuquerque having fallen, General Bornot, commander of the Army of
the West, had withdrawn his forces to the old capital of New Mexico,
there to make a last, desperate stand.

It was a valiant, but doomed, defense. The very fact that intimate
details of the battle were televised shows how vastly superior the
Totie forces were; their airplanes could fly without hindrance over our
lines, spying out resources, reserves, and the pitifully weak remnants
of our Army.

Like our own demolished Eastern army, the westerners were a motley
crew. I saw French, English, Scandinavian and Canadian uniforms; loyal
Sikhs from India fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with kilted Scots;
swarthy refugees from Totie Mexico and Guatemala defending futile
breaches beside blonde, fair-skinned Icelanders.

The main body of attackers stormed up from captive Albuquerque to the
south; these were the trained warriors of Japan, the yellow horde that
had ravaged California, Arizona and Utah and pressed eastward to meet
Kievinovski's command. The Russians came down from the north, cutting
off any avenue of escape through Taos. ("Once," Dr. Mallory told us
sadly, "Taos was the artistic center of the United States. Now but one
pigment flows there; the red of blood.") And Schneider's Army of the
Mississippi had swept westward through Arkansas and Oklahoma, leaving
nothing but waste and desolation behind them, to meet the other armies
at this last defense post of democratic gallantry.

It was no battle at all, really; it was a slaughter. Our army had
refortified old Fort Marcy, earthworks built by General Kearny more
than a hundred years ago. Two divisions were quartered in the Garita,
the old Spanish headquarters. Thus they lay, more than four thousand
Democratic troops--waiting behind breastworks of earth and 'dobe for
the attack of armies whose artillery was built to blast steel and
concrete pill-boxes out of existence.

Even so, the gallantry of their defense turned the blood in my veins
to electricity. They did not wait for the Toties to attack; they
carried the fight to the enemy. With the first, tentative shot from the
besiegers there came an answering blast from the besiezed. Then the
bedlam was on.

Stream upon endless stream, the Toties flooded into the city. As they
did so, we--and the enemy--discovered that the spying televise had
not told the whole story. Windows opened to expose spitting, snarling
machine guns. Doorways gaped to expose light fieldpieces that poured
fiery death into the Toties. Fake walls split miraculously, from them
charged concealed troops of Americans, faces grim, guns flaming,
roaring, bayonets flashing.

Guerrilla warfare became the order of the day. At street barricades
powder and flame were forgotten as men met face to face, looked with
stark eyes upon dripping steel. Americans and their allies fell, but
for each of them fell two, three, a half dozen of the invaders. The
scream of explosives was deafening, the street pictured on the metallic
screen before us was a shambles of blood; bodies lay asprawl like the
forgotten toys of a careless child.

And--the televise screen went blank!

Danny Wilson loosed a great cry of joy. "They're licked!" he roared.
"The dog-whelped cowards are licked! I never knew of them to turn off a
televised victory--"

For five glorious minutes we shared his hope. Then the broadcast was
resumed, after a murmured comment about a "technical difficulty in
transmission"--and when again our eyes looked upon the streets of Santa
Fé, the picture had changed.

Once more it was aircraft that had won the day. In the face of
impending disaster, the Toties had loosed the full power of their air
armada against the beleaguered forces. It did not matter to them that
their thermite bombs fell amongst their men as well as ours; that was a
hazard their hirelings had been trained to accept. Burst after flaming
burst rocked the streets of old Santa Fé, broken bodies were flung
brutally against shattered walls, doorways and windows emptied--and
there were no more defenders. Only fresh, unending troops of Toties
filling the gaps left by their fellows.

       *       *       *       *       *

I saw the Garita fall, a flaming shambles; I saw an airplane swoop low
over breastworks hastily flung up at the _Puenta de Los Hidalgos_ and
wipe out a company of Americans. I heard the biting rasp of machine gun
fire, the staccato bark of anti-aircraft; once the visiplate before us
whirled giddily for an instant as the plane in which our broadcaster
rode narrowly escaped disaster.

I saw the last great moment of Fort Marcy; the fall of the gates and
the horde of snarling Toties that rushed in, bayonetting all before
them; I saw the bayonet wielded that slashed the rope holding the
American flag to the flagpost. I saw the man who turned and raced to
that flagpost, grasped the ropes and held them taut as, for a moment
longer, the tattered ensign whipped out through the smoke and flame.

Then I saw the bullet that found this unknown hero's breast; saw him
cough and loose his grasp, slip earthward as the flag above him tumbled
to the dirt. There was a look of hurt surprise in his eyes. Then I saw
no more, because my eyes were wet. And Dr. Mallory said, "There is
nothing more to see--"

And turned off the televise.

       *       *       *       *       *

Yes, that was the 29th day of July, 1963. I remember it well. For it
was after that I asked Mallory, "Do we go now? There is no reason to
delay."

And he said, "We will leave in five days. By that time all will be in
readiness. And the third of August will be a day of good omen. It was
on that day, centuries ago, that a humble Portuguese sailorman with a
great dream sailed westward to the Indies and found a new world.

"Like Chistofero Colon, we will select that date to set our course for
New America--"

Maureen's hand tightened on mine. Krassner, who had been watching the
televise silently, gaped at us.

"New course? Go? Go where?"

"Skip it--!" I began. But Dr. Mallory stopped me. "No, I think it is
well the men should be told now, O'Shea. My helpers know. Your men, who
must be the fighters of our party, should be told where they are going."

And he told them. It came as a stunning blow. Some of them looked
frightened; some, to be quite truthful, simply did not understand.
Others were openly incredulous. Among these was Krassner. He
epostulated, "But--but, O'Shea, this old fool must be insane! Flight to
the Moon! Absurd!"

His eyes narrowed.

"There's more to it than that. This is a trick of some kind I'll bet
it's tied up with that mysterious invention you've got hidden in your
closet--"

I grasped him by the shoulder, whirled him about.

"Then you _did_ hear us that day?"

"Sure. I heard you. Is there anything wrong in that? I couldn't help
hearing you say you had a weapon that would end the war. If that's what
you've got, trot it out! That's a lot better than dying like rats on a
fool's expedition to the _Moon_!

"Luna! Pah! I, for one, won't have anything to do with it--"

I said hotly, "You damned fool, we can't open that closet. Don't you
realize--?"

"Brian!" snapped Dr. Mallory.

I shut up suddenly. Krassner looked at me, then at the old man
suspiciously. He snarled, "You reminded me once that I had no authority
over your command, O'Shea. Well, now I remind you that you have no
authority over me. I'm pulling out of here. I've had enough of this
insane secrecy and--"

He started for the door. I said only one word.

"Lars!"

Lars Frynge, the towering Swede, had his revolver at Krassner's
midsection. He said amiably, "Ay tank maybe you batter lissen to
Captain, hey?"

Krassner's face purpled. He bellowed, "This is the last straw, O'Shea.
Insulting an officer and an equal! By the gods, I'll--"

He was right. He was an officer and an equal. But I was determined of
one thing. Go with us he would, whether he liked it or not. But in the
meanwhile--

"All right, Lars," I said. "Krassner, I'm sorry. I wasn't just trying
to throw my weight around. But think it over carefully, man. This means
a lot to all of us. You're at liberty to do what you will."

He snorted and strode from the room. Danny Wilson cocked an eyebrow
at me; I nodded. Danny followed him. Maureen said nervously, "He's a
trouble-maker, Brian. I don't think we should trust him out of our
sight."

"That's why Danny left us," I grinned.

"And when we go, we should leave without him."

"That," said Mallory, "is impossible. When we go, there must remain no
one behind to know where we have gone."

       *       *       *       *       *

And there were five days left in which to finish all that had to be
done before our departure. Those were days of feverish excitement and
activity for all of us. Having been let into the secret, my men were
shown the way to the underground cavern. There they labored, side by
side with Mallory's helpers, to load the cargo, put the last finishing
touches on the _Jefferson_.

We stripped the house; we gathered all forage from the barns and silos
and bins. We rolled cask upon cask of fresh spring water into the
holds. We locked and sealed the holds, one by one.

Danny raised a fuss about that. He had found something new and
wonderful--something I meant to investigate myself as soon as the
opportunity permitted. The joy of reading fiction.

"It--it's swell, Brian!" he told me. "Boy, I wish I'd lived in them
days when magazines was common. You ought to read some of them stories.
Sports and detective stories and--" He looked sort of sheepish. "The
ones I like best are science stories. Gosh, you'd be surprised, Brian.
Them old writers guessed sometimes pretty near what was going to happen.

"There was a guy named Bender, or Binder, or something like that, who
guessed 'way back in '40, at the start of this war, that we'd get into
it. And there was another guy named Clinton who said the same thing--he
was nuts, though. He said the women would bust loose from the men and
set up their own government.

"And those others, they predicted things like the spaceship we'll soon
be riding in. And television, and--"

I said, "Those magazines must be plenty old."

"They are. Ancient. But they're still fun. Brian, can't I sneak a few
of them into my berth instead of sealing them up in the library? Do you
think Doc would mind?"

"I guess not," I told him. So he did just that. By the time he'd
finished robbing the library, it looked moth-eaten and there was
scarcely enough room in his berth for him to turn around in....

Those were full days and exciting ones, but pleasant. It is hard to
realize that we were living on the bright edge of grave calamity. Nor
did we know it until the eve of the day on which we were to take off.

It started with a thin, high droning to the north. The familiar drone
of aircraft. As always, under these circumstances, Dr. Mallory sounded
the "Take cover!" signal, and everyone scurried to the shelter of the
camouflaged grove, there to wait until the danger should pass.

But it did not pass. The droning came nearer, deepened in tone. And we
saw, through the leafy veil that concealed us, that it was not a single
plane that was approaching, nor a single flight--but a solid phalanx of
enemy aircraft!

Even then we did not guess the dreadful truth. It was not until they
had come directly over us, swung into an involute loop and began
concentrating upon us, that we knew what was happening. Then we saw
something dark and ominous loose itself from the rack of one bomber; a
thin screaming filled the air--and in the woods to our right there came
a frightful blast!

Earth shook beneath us, Maureen screamed needless words in my ear.

"They're bombing _us_, Brian! They've found our refuge!"


                                  VI

There was only one thing that spared all of us in those next few
minutes. That was the fact that the Toties did not know _exactly_ where
we were. Somehow they had learned the approximate location of Dr.
Mallory's mountain hide-away, but not in vain had the aged scientist
spent twenty years nurturing plant life to form a perfect barricade of
concealment about the dim, squat buildings. From above, the wooded dell
that hid his laboratory must have looked like one of thousands such.

Therefore they scattered their shots. One bomb exploded a quarter mile
from Mallory's house; I learned afterward that it killed two workmen
who had been laying in cordwood. Others exploded as far as five miles
away as the hive of lethal wasps eddied back and forth, bombing the
entire countryside with abandon.

A thousand questions seethed through my brain, but there was no time
now to ponder the answers. No time to ask why, or how, the Toties had
learned of this place. I seized Maureen's elbow, half-led, half-dragged
her toward the laboratory. Above the crashing din I howled in her ear,
"To the cavern! That's the only safe--"

The rest was lost in an ear-splitting thunderbolt. But she knew what I
meant.

We were not the only ones who fled to the security of the house.
The lab was the lodestone toward which all we tiny, helpless motes
gravitated. By the time we reached it, the shaking walls were jammed
with soldiers, workers, women, who had sought refuge there.

A few of these were itching for action. Such a one was Danny Wilson.
He was pleading with Mallory, "How about it, Doc? Just one of them
anti-craft guns? We can get it up here in no time."

"No. They don't know just where we are, Wilson. A shot would locate us
definitely. We must remain silent and take our chances against a lucky
placement."

Krassner, his handsome face oddly pale, clutched at Mallory's arm.

"This cavern you were talking about, Mallory. Take us there! We'll all
be blown to bits--"

Joe Sanders' nose wrinkled, he looked at the airman disgustedly, and
spat. Mingled with my own contemptuous reaction to Krassner's demand,
I felt a warming glow of pride in my men. Each of them had realized,
as had Maureen and I, that the only safe place was the underground
shelter. But each of them had wanted, before we took to that refuge, at
least one vengeful poke at the enemy. Quivering capitulation like this
rubbed them the wrong way.

But Mallory, serene as ever, had already led the way to the secret
entrance. He pressed the knobs, the door swung open. I was beside
Krassner as he did so; I saw the look of surprise on the aviator's face
as he saw the long tunnel that fed to the depths beneath. I couldn't
restrain the taunt.

"Thought Mallory was insane, eh, Krassner? Does this look like the work
of a madman?"

He muttered something incoherent. Then Pelham-Jones, whose squad had
been quartered farthest from the main house, burst into the room
excitedly.

"They're landing foray parties, Brian! How long will it take to get
everyone out of here?"

I glanced at Mallory. He said, "Fifteen or twenty minutes, at least."

"And to get the _Jefferson's_ motors started?"

"Another ten."

"Then," I snapped, "you'll need protection for a half hour. That's
what we're here for. Bruce, Rudy, Raoul, split your squads. Send half
below; have the others throw a cordon about the laboratory. If they're
dropping infantry, they'll have to stop bombing. By the time they find
us, the others will be below. Then we'll take to the cavern--"

"Very good, sir!" They sprang into action.

       *       *       *       *       *

The women continued to file singly into the small dark-room, pass
through the doorway into the tunnel. Maureen clutched my arm.

"Brian, you don't have to stay up here. You're too important. You're
the leader. You've got to--"

"--to stay with my men!" I told her quietly. And I did what I had been
wanting to do, but had never before dared. I took her, unresisting,
into my arms; kissed her. Her lips were warm against mine. Then I
pushed her toward the doorway. "Get down there. Don't worry about us.
If we hold our fire it will take them a long time to locate us. Danny,
where did Krassner go?"

Danny grimaced.

"That yellow mutt? Don't ask me. He's probably down there by now,
hugging a stalactite."

"Well, to hell with him. Let's get going. And don't forget--don't fire
a shot unless they actually see us. We don't want to give our position
away."

Mallory said quietly, "I'll herd them below as fast as I can, Brian.
When you hear the signal, bring your men on the double. But before
you leave the laboratory, you know what must be done?" He nodded
significantly toward the inner room, toward the trebly-barred door
that contained a world's fate. I nodded.

"I know."

The steady evacuation continued. I went outside again. As Pelham-Jones
had reported, the Tories were parachuting infantry to the ground. More
planes had reached the scene; the sky swarmed with them. And a mass
occupation was in progress; from each transport rumbled a steady stream
of dark figures that, like strange, winged insects, plunged out of
their humming cocoons, hurtled headlong toward Earth for a moment--then
suddenly grew filmy, white umbrellas that lowered them gently to the
ground.

It was a random, haphazard occupation for the Toties _still_ had not
solved the secret of our exact location. But many--too many--were
dropping near our sheltered grove. It would not take them long, I knew,
to find us.

Happily, the aerial bombardment had ceased with the dropping of the
infantry. That was good. No chance explosion would find the heart of
our refuge, destroy the lab and cut us off from the underground cavern.

Approximately twenty of us remained above ground as defenders. I told
MacGregor, "Encircle the house. Defend it at all costs until you hear
Mallory's call--then hightail it for the tunnel. I've got something to
do inside."

I went back to the door beyond which were concealed the lethal
anaesthetic spores. There were two barrels of oil there; we had placed
them there for the purpose I now carried out. I broke them open,
spilled their contents every which way. Now a single match would set
the house ablaze, destroy forever the danger Mallory had feared. I
would strike that match just before ducking into the tunnel myself--

A single, explosive crack sounded outside! A rifle had spoken!

       *       *       *       *       *

That ripped it! With that shot there came a moment of macabre silence;
then the air was alive with an answering volley from the hills and
woods surrounding us. I raced out of the house, found Rudy Van Huys. I
roared angrily, "Who fired! Why? Good God, man, don't you realize--"

His pink, chubby cheeks shook with anger to match my own. He said, "I
don't know, Brian. They hadn't spotted us until then. But now--"

He didn't need to point to the forest; I could see the grey-green
uniforms sifting through the trees, closing in on us. The _spang!_ of
a Wentzler shrilled in my ears, spent lead splattered against the wall
behind me. All about us, now, rifle fire rasped and spat; I saw an
advancing Totie soldier stop short in his tracks, stagger, spin, and
fall, clutching his stomach with red hands that clawed. I heard a grunt
from one of the men beside me, saw his mouth form an astonished O and
an ugly, purple-black third eye appear magically in the middle of his
forehead. The back of his head....

Then came a welcome sound, a cry from Mallory.

"All clear, O'Shea! Bring your men!"

They came on the double. Not all of them. Half of them, maybe. Those
few minutes of gunfire, raking our fearfully exposed position, had cost
us. MacGregor, huge bear of a man, staggered around an ell of the house
carrying a still figure. Danny Wilson. I cried, "Mac, is he--?"

"Bad, Brian! Mighty bad." MacGregor lumbered into the house with his
burden; the rest of the men followed him, lingering to throw last shots
into the advancing force before they disappeared.

There remained, still, my most important task. Now the Toties had
apparently brought up several pieces of light artillery, for mingled
with the snap of musketry I heard the familiar coughing bark of
ordnance. Once the house shuddered and quaked, concussion deafened my
ear drums as a shell found us. But I sped down the empty corridors
toward the lab. Time was precious. All too soon the Toties would close
in on the house; before that I must toss my flame, race back to the
tunnel entrance.

I burst into the room, at last, and--

--and stood aghast! I had only presence of mind to throw a shielding
arm across my face, hold my breath. For no longer was the closet
sealed. The bars had been smashed inward, the lock was a shard of
broken metal, the door a heap of splinters. The gods of chance had
tossed a die for our enemies. That shell I had heard--had found its
way into the granary of death!

I had a momentary glimpse of the inside of the closet. I saw grey,
fungoid granules sifting through the broken door; a cloud whirled and
eddied toward me. To breathe that cloud meant oblivion. Beating at my
clothes, my hair, with suddenly frenzied fingers, I turned and fled
from the room.

In the hallway I stopped, ignited the box of matches I carried, tossed
the blazing brand onto the oil-soaked floor. Flame licked hungrily
along those stained boards; the bright fire-flower grew before my eyes.
Even so, I knew my effort was in vain. The shell had entered through
the walls of the house, and even now I could see those spores of
slumber sifting out to float with the winds.

An agonized cry brought me to my senses. Mallory's voice, "Brian!
Brian, lad--where are you!"

I turned and fled toward the secret portal. I made it just in time.
The aged doctor and I were the last to enter the tunnel as the first
Totie set foot in the laboratory. Stumbling, panting, we raced down
that smooth slope to where the _Jefferson_ awaited us. A dull throbbing
wakened echoes in the hollow depths; eager hands helped us into the
air-lock.

I heard Mallory gasp, "Take off! _Now!_" The humming deepened to a
frightful roar, the Niagara of powers beyond comprehension. I was dimly
aware of a cascade of broken rock smashing down about the _Jefferson's_
permalloy casing, of an unearthly sheet of flame mirrored through
quartzite windows. Then a tremendous tug pulled me to my knees, my
lungs strained for precious air, blood danced before my eyes and there
was agony in my bones....


                                  VII

Earth was a tremendous disc, swaddled in lacy veils of gleaming
white, when next I looked upon it from the control turret of the
_Jefferson_. I did not look for long. I had, when I turned my gaze
upon it, some vague idea of being able to determine (if nothing else)
broad continental outlines of the sphere from which we were roaring at
a speed which Mallory had told me was approximately 25,000 miles per
hour.

But the sheen was so terrifically blinding that I had to shut my eyes.
Dr. Mallory, no longer so intent over his instruments now that he had
checked his course and found it satisfactory, noticed the movement,
reached over and turned the pane through which I had been looking a
quarter-turn in its grooved frame. Immediately the burning radiance
dimmed into murky grayness.

"Earth-shine, Brian," he answered my unspoken query. "Our mother planet
is a great reflecting body. At this distance it is even more painful to
look upon with the naked eye than is the sun."

Maureen said, "But the moon, Doctor? We don't seem to be moving toward
it?"

"We aren't. It's moving toward us. Or perhaps I should say both it
and we are moving toward a mutual point in space where our paths will
intersect in--" He glanced at a chronometer and at his calculations.
"In a little less than eight and a half hours.

"Before that, however. Brian," he turned to me seriously, "there will
be a few minutes that I am afraid will be rather uncomfortable for our
party. The period of absolute weightlessness when we reach the 'dead
spot'; the spot where the gravitational forces of Earth and its moon
are completely nullified by each other.

"You might go below and warn everyone that this is to be expected. Bid
them not to be alarmed."

Someone coughed apologetically at the turret door. It was St. Cloud.
His face was granitelike, but his eyes were haggard. He said, "Brian--"

"Yes?"

"It's Danny."

"Danny? Is he--?"

He nodded. "I'm afraid so. He'd like to see you."

       *       *       *       *       *

I followed him swiftly down the ramp, through the corridors, and into
the sick bay. There were a half dozen of the men in there receiving
first aid treatment from one of Dr. Mallory's assistants. Wilson was in
one of the private wards off the main hospital room.

He turned his head slowly as I entered, essayed a grin that froze,
suddenly, as a spasm shook him. But he said, in a low, husky voice,
"Hyah, Cap!"

I said, "Hayah, yourself, soldier!" and motioned the others to get out.
The door closed softly behind them. "Got a blighty one, did you?" I
said.

He said laboriously, "You wouldn't kid a guy, would you, Brian? I got
a west one this time." His hands plucked at the sheet covering him,
drew it down. Even the bandages had not been able to staunch that slow,
staining seepage. I drew the cover back again.

"You're tough, Irish," I told him. "You'll get over that one before
breakfast."

But I had a hard time saying it; the words rang false from my lips. I
was lying, and he knew it as well as I. He shook his head.

"I don't much give a damn, Brian. I got the guy who done it, and a
couple others for good measure. There's only one thing I'm sorry about."

"Yes, Irish?"

"That story. It was about a guy named Kinniston. A Lensman. He was
in a hell of a jam. I'd like to have known if he got out." He said
plaintively, "I can't lift my hands, Brian, boy. They're so damned
weak...."

I said, "One of those magazines? Where is it?" He nodded to the chair
beside his bed. I picked the thing up, found the place where he'd left
off. I started reading to him the story that had captured his fancy.
It wasn't easy. I hadn't read much of anything since I left military
training school at the age of thirteen. A lot of the words were
unfamiliar, and I guess I made pretty heavy weather of it.

But he seemed to be enjoying it. He lay back on the pillows, breathing
hard, so intent on the adventures of this "Gray Lensman," printed in an
old and yellowed fiction book, that he almost forgot the icy fingers
closing in upon him.

He only interrupted me once. That was to say suddenly, "Brian--it was
Krassner, you know."

"What?"

"He fired ... the shot."

The shot that had betrayed us! I was reminded, forcibly, that I hadn't
seen Krassner aboard ship. I didn't know whether he'd made it or not.
But if he had--

"Go on ... Brian. Get him out of trouble before...."

So I read on. It was weirdly strange, sitting there reading a story of
spaceflight adventure written twenty years ago. While we, ourselves,
soared the void in a craft bound for Earth's satelite. But I read on.
And it must have been ten minutes before I sensed something wrong. At
first I couldn't figure what it was. Then, suddenly, I realized. It was
the fact that Danny's breathing no longer rasped beside me....

I rose and closed the magazine. I hope that somehow he knows, now, how
the Lensman fought his way out of that jam.

       *       *       *       *       *

I went back to the turret, then. But on the way I sought out Ronnie and
Mac and Rudy. I asked them about Krassner. They hadn't seen him.

"But we will! If he's aboard this ship, we'll dig him out!"

They were gathering their squads into search parties as I left. In the
control room, Dr. Mallory had just completed another check-up and minor
course revision. He was jubilant because the _Jefferson_ was reacting
so beautifully. "Another six hours, Brian, and we'll be there. I've
been teaching Maureen to operate the ship. She's an apt pupil."

Maureen flushed with pleasure. Mallory continued, "I'm glad we have
another pilot. Now she can make the next trip back to earth, pick up
more colonists while we build our Lunar colony--"

I started, and looked at him swiftly. Then he didn't know! I said,
"Doctor--those spores. How swiftly do they propogate?"

"With drastic swiftness, Brian, lad. That's why I kept them in a
sealed, sterile chamber. Had they ever been loosed, within two month's
time all Earth would have succumbed to their somnivorous power. But why
do you ask--?" A sudden look of fear swept his features; his voice rose.

"Brian! You destroyed the spores? I saw flames leaping before you
entered the tunnel--"

And then I told him.

It took him a good while to speak again. And when he spoke, his voice
was deep with sorrow. He glanced at the dim shadow of earth outlined on
the polaroid window, and his hands made a yearning gesture.

"That which I feared most has come to pass. We are powerless to prevent
it. We might have time for two, three, a half dozen trips to Earth to
save a few refugees from the sleep to come--but even that is unsafe.
Were a single spore to get into the ship, be borne back to Luna, our
colony, too, would be stilled in centuries, aeons of slumber. You're
_sure_ the spores escaped, Brian?"

"I'm sure."

"Then soon we will be the last of Earth's waking children. Our
responsibility is graver than ever. Now must we not only keep alive the
spirit of liberty, but all man's dreamed-of future is in our hands."

Maureen cried desperately, "But the responsibility is too great,
Dr. Mallory. Surely you, who invented the spores, know some way to
counteract their action? Isn't there some way to effectively destroy
them?"

"None, my dear. None ... except ..." His eyes dimmed uncertainly. "I
don't know. Maybe. There's a faint, far possibility. Once, as I was
experimenting, I happened to expose certain of the spore-plasm to
synthetic chlorophyll. A reaction took place, a sloughing of the spore
cell. I was not interested in that at the time, so I didn't pursue the
experiment. But it is remotely possible...."

"We must try, then," I told him. "As soon as we get to Luna, you
must try that experiment again. Try it on your sleeping assistant,
Williamson. Better he should die now than slumber on forever in his
glass coffin.

"And if the antidote works, we'll be in a position to reclaim Earth.
Sweep away the plague, and while doing so, end the war in the very
fashion you once planned."

"I'll do it!" he cried excitedly. "Chlorophyll must be the answer! As
soon as we reach--"

He stopped abruptly. Footsteps were pounding up the runway; breathless
men were tumbling into the room. Big Mac was at their head, his brow
was red with unbridled rage. He yelled at me, "Brian! We've found him!
We've found the dirty, skulking rat!"

"Krassner, you mean?" I thought again of Danny, and of those others who
had died because of Krassner's revealing gun shot. My anger flared to
match MacGregor's. "Where is he? Bring him in!"

"We've got to take him. He's barricaded himself in the aft storage
compartment and threatens to blow the ship to hell if we make a move!"


                                 VIII

For a moment, everything before my eyes was outlined in crimson. As
from afar I heard my own voice gritting, "Get your men together! Follow
me--"

Then Dr. Mallory's sharp command, "No, Brian! Don't move hastily. He
has the upper hand. He can do just what he threatens. Those aft storage
bins are loaded with explosive, inflammable substances. Maybe we can
reason with him--" He turned to Maureen. "Hold the ship to its course,
my dear. I will be back in a few minutes."

We moved aft. Mallory and myself, MacGregor and Ian Pelham-Jones,
Devereaux. We passed through the bulkhead that sealed the forward from
the aft portion of the ship, hurried down a long corridor, and came to
the carriage lock beyond which lay the storage bins, the engineers'
berths, the recreation room and the library.

This door was closed; before it, tense, nervous, uncertain, hovered a
dozen of my men. Van Huys headed them; he looked up at me, his pale
blue eyes troubled.

"He's in there, Brian. I think the man's gone mad!"

Mallory raised his voice, called mildly, "Krassner?"

There was a shuffling sound from behind the lock. A moment's silence,
then Krassner, suspiciously, "Well?"

"What's the matter, my friend? You mustn't act like this. What is it
you want?"

"Turn the ship back to Earth!"

"But we can't do that." Mallory's voice was soothing, persuasive.
"We've set our course. We can't return."

"You must, damn you!"

I couldn't restrain myself any longer. I brushed by Mallory, cried,
"Krassner, you're acting like an idiot! Come out of there immediately!"

Again there was a brief instant of stillness. Then Krassner's tone
altered subtlely, became half-mocking. "Is that you, O'Shea?"

"Yes."

"The gallant captain of a drag-tailed company. You want to save your
command, don't you, Captain? Then make the old fool turn this ship
back, and do it _now_!"

Wrath inflamed me; I stepped forward and hammered on the metal door.
There came the sound of swift, frightened movements inside. Krassner
yelled sharply, incisively, "Don't try to come in here, O'Shea. I can
blast this ship to shards, and by the Banner, I'll--"

He stopped abruptly, aware that in his excitement he had finally given
himself away. But if he was startled, I was even more so. Suddenly,
now, it all made sense. I wondered why I had not guessed the truth
before. But I am not a clever man; I am just a soldier. And we had met
Krassner under circumstances that favored his deceit.

I said slowly, "So you're not one of us, after all, Krassner? You're
one of them?"

He had recovered his aplomb. He laughed stridently. In my mind's eye I
could see his face, thin lips drawn in a tight smile, those too-close
eyes lifted at the corners with mockery. His voice was a taunt.

"Congratulations, O'Shea, on having played the dupe so long and so
excellently. Allow me to introduce myself in my proper character.
Captain Jacob Krassner of the Imperial German Army--at your service!"

It was all too clear, now. I remembered the day we had met Krassner,
seen him "shot down" by an enemy plane. I remembered MacGregor's
comment at the time. "Damned funny. First Totie I ever saw who didn't
gun a parachuter."

And that day I had caught him listening to us from Mallory's outer
office. His restless wanderings around the laboratory grounds; now I
knew he had been seeking the hide-away of the _Jefferson_. And the
betraying rifle-shot--

"You Americans are a naïve race," Krassner was saying amusedly. "It
never occurred to you, did it, O'Shea, that I might have concealed on
me a portable transmitter? It was I who exposed the location of the
laboratory to our gallant forces. We had suspected for some time that
strange things were brewing near Cleft Canyon. That is why I--shall we
say 'dropped into the picture'? To learn the meaning of certain things
that puzzled us."

He was a braggart, like the rest of them. Now that he had given himself
away--only Toties swore "by the Banner"--he was gloating triumphantly.
And he held the upper hand. We could not even tell him that which we
knew; that Earth was doomed, that already hundreds of thousands of his
compatriots as well as ours by quiescent in dreadful, sleeping undeath.
If he discovered the Totie cause was lost--well, they were ever ones
for the heroic, the vainglorious gesture. And his hand controlled
forces that would blast us all into nothingness.

       *       *       *       *       *

I glanced about me nervously. The faces of the men mirrored my anxiety,
Mallory's brow was heavy with fear, Van Huys gnawed his full lower lip
savagely. Only the gleaming metalwork of the corridor was impassive;
that and the heavy door that barred us from a traitor and an enemy. A
grilled square, high in the walls of the corridor, was like a great,
fanged, laughing mouth. I stared at it.

"Mallory!" I whispered the name. "What is that?"

"Eh?" He followed my glance. "Oh--that? Part of the ventilation system.
But, why--?" Then he grasped the reason for my sudden eagerness. "Yes,
Brian. It feeds into every chamber. We'll give you a hand. Bruce--"

Krassner's voice came to us, suspicious. "What are you whispering about
out there? I warn you, don't attempt to enter this room. If you do,
we'll all die together!"

Mallory somehow managed to keep his tone steady.

"Krassner, you're an intelligent man. Listen--"

"Keep him talking, Doctor!" I whispered. I nodded to MacGregor; his
huge hands cupped to give me a hand-up to the grill. My fingers tore
at the four studs that bolted it into position. One came out. Another.
All eyes were upon me as I lifted the heavy grill from its position,
lowered it into the outstretched hands. Only Mallory continued talking,
pleading, arguing, reassuring. Stalling for precious time.

I nodded, MacGregor's shoulders heaved, and I was scrambling into the
smooth bore of the ventilating system. It was narrow, but not too
narrow; the air was cool, clean-smelling. I crept from the opening, was
lost in darkness.

A native sense of direction, keen-edged by years of guerrilla warfare,
aided me in threading that black labyrinth. How long the creeping
journey took, I had no way of knowing. It seemed endless, for I moved
slowly, cautiously, dreading the revelatory scrape of clothing upon
metal, the sound that might send Krassner suddenly into action.

A turn, a rise, a descent, and another turn. Then before me loomed
a networked square of light. And the sound of Krassner's voice was
no longer muffled; it reached my ears loudly. "--fine organization,
O'Shea, where the soldiers address their 'captain' by his first name.
But we will teach you obedience, you Yankee up-starts! We--"

I was at the grill. There was no way to unscrew it from the inside.
What could be done must be done--and in a single, sure move--from here.

Krassner stood a few yards from the barred and bolted door. He had
not been bluffing. He had prepared the way for the destruction of the
_Jefferson_ in the event his demands were refused, his scheme went
awry. The end of a coiled fuse lay beside him, he toyed nervously with
an electro-lighter as he talked. But now his patience was wearing thin.
He said, "But enough of this conversation! Are you, or are you not,
going to turn about? Your answer now, or by the Banner--"

Mallory answered reluctantly, "Krassner, once more I beg of you to
listen to reason."

"The time for reason is past. I want action. You, O'Shea! Speak to me!
Are you going to turn the ship?"

Silence. I eased my revolver from its bolster with infinite slowness.
I saw a puzzled look appear on Krassner's features, turn to a look of
sudden doubt.

"O'Shea! Where are you? Speak to me!"

My gun spoke for me.

       *       *       *       *       *

Krassner never suffered for the misery he brought on others. He never
knew what struck him. My shot crashed into his brain like a Jovian
bolt. Without a word, a whimper, a groan, he collapsed where he stood,
his lips still parted in the question he had been hurling at the door
upon which, now my comrades were battering.

But even in death, Krassner was destined to throw a last blow amongst
us. My cavernous eyrie echoed with a roaring blast; when my deafened
ears could hear again they heard a sizzling crackle. The stench of
burning powder stung my nostrils.

I craned to look down through the grill; saw there that which damped
my forehead coldly. Krassner's weapon had been the hand flame-thrower
of our enemy. The stricken convulsion of his fist had shot a withering
blast of flame upon the fuse. Now a charred line of fire was racing to
the charge Krassner had prepared.

In frantic haste I screamed this knowledge to those beyond the
door. "You've got to get in somehow! Stop that fuse!" Their efforts
redoubled. I heard the ringing crash of metal upon metal which meant
they had brought up a pry, then came a hissing sound, and at the
doorjamb, by the hinges, metal warmed, turned orange, glowed cherry
red. A blowtorch!

I could do no good behind this grill. It was the act of a contortionist
to turn in that meager space, but somehow I accomplished it, scrambled
desperately toward the corridor grill through which I had entered the
air-duct.

It was just as I gained the opening that the hinges of the lock finally
gave way, the door burst open. Even I was not prepared for that which
appeared through the frame. The entire aperture was one solid sheet of
flame. Despite their eagerness, no one could blame my men for falling
back, horrified, from the scorching fingers that leaped out to grasp
them.

All but one! And that one was Dr. Thomas Mallory. Perhaps it was
because he alone realized the vital necessity of jerking that fuse
from its charge before everything ended in one coruscant moment. Arms
locked before his face, head lowered, he dashed recklessly into that
flaming hell!

I fell--or dropped, I know not which--from my outlet, found myself on
my feet, heard myself bellowing, "Water! We've got to stop that fire
before--"

But they knew that. Already someone had raced to the jets, another
was tugging desperately at a reel of fire hose. I suppose what I did
next was heroic. Either that or damned, blind foolishness. It could
not have been deliberate heroism, for there was no time to measure the
chances, weigh the consequences. I leaped through the doorway, followed
Dr. Mallory. And even so, there was another figure at my side. That of
burly Bruce MacGregor.

We found him at the same time. He lay face down on the floor, arms
outstretched before him. But in one blistered hand was--the end of the
fuse. Scant inches from its charred end stood piled boxes of Triple-X,
most deadly of all explosives. The flames had not yet quite reached it,
but in another moment--

Then the water came! Like a solid fist it caught me in the middle of
the back, shot me, sprawling, forward. The breath shot from my lungs
before that impact--but never had I been more grateful for a bruising
blow.

MacGregor, a sorry sight with his blistered cheeks, scorched hair,
spark-charred garments, bent his brute strength against the flood,
roared directions.

"Here! On these boxes first! Soak them, ruin them! We can fight the
fire later...."

       *       *       *       *       *

We got Dr. Mallory out of that furnace. How long we battled the fire
after that is hard to say. At least an hour. Krassner had planned his
coup with deadly Teutonic thoroughness. Not only had he arranged the
fuse and explosive charge; he had also soaked walls, drapes, furniture,
with gasoline.

Against this, our water was useless. We had no sand. Men labored to
drag the lethal crates of explosive out of the danger zone; after
that we went back at the ever-spreading fire. Chemicals did the trick
finally. The last blaze succumbed to the stifling blanket of carbon
dioxide, a clean-up crew methodically swept up the last of the charred
débris.

Thus died Krassner--but at what a cost! Ten of my men in the hospital,
at least two of them seriously burned. Three whole bins of provisions
gone forever, devoured by the hungriest of all foes. A binful of
linens, clothing, blankets, burned to cinders. And every other room
that had been in that aft section of the ship gutted!

All these disasters paled into insignificance when, bandaged, cleaned,
reclad, I went to visit Dr. Mallory. One look at his face and I knew
that here was the heaviest price we were to pay for the destruction
of our last mortal foe. Only Mallory's eyes were visible under the
swaddling mask of bandage, and these were raw and bloodshot. But the
ghost of a smile lighted these fine old eyes, and his voice, sieved
through a layer of gauze, said weakly:

"I ... reached there in time ... Brian, lad."

"You did that," I told him huskily. "You saved us all, Doctor."

"Not only us, but ... mankind. We _had_ to live, Brian. You must
lead ... our people ... out of the wilderness."

I said, "Not I, Doctor. _You._ You are the only man who can save us,
reclaim the sleeping world--"

He said, as though not hearing me, "It's a good ... thing I showed
Maureen ... how to run the ship. Isn't it? Now she can take us to Luna.

"Brian, boy ... find the notes ... in my desk. They'll help you. I
believe ... you'll find the crater of Copernicus ... the best place to
land. There will be air there. Thin, maybe. But air. In the underground
grottoes ... should be ... water...."

       *       *       *       *       *

A spasm shook him; his eyes closed for a moment in pain, then opened
again. They were febrilely bright.

"Most important of all ... Brian ... the spores. You must find a
way ... to destroy them. Go back to Earth ... and awaken man ... to
a new, a peaceful, world."

He was silent so long that I cried out, "Doctor!" I couldn't say more.

But he spoke again, and for the last time. "I am sure now ... Brian ...
you will find the answer ... in chlorophyll. Keep after it. The fate of
all ... mankind ... is in only your...."

And that was all. His eyes closed, then, as if they had finally found
peace. I turned away. Maureen covered his face tenderly. She came to my
side, and her voice was soft.

"He was right, Brian. You are our leader now. It is up to you to find
the antidote for Earth's illness."

I stared at her long and bitterly. My voice must have been harsh.

"I! I, Maureen? Tell me--do you know the formula for chlorophyll? Do I?
Does anyone aboard this ship, now _he_ is gone?"

"Don't be upset, Brian. No, we don't--but there's no cause for despair.
It, and everything else you need know, is at our disposal. That's why
he went to such pains to provide a scientific library for the ship. All
man's knowledge lies there, waiting for us to seek it out."

I took a deep breath. I said, "That's just it, Maureen. I couldn't
bring myself to tell him. But--"

"But, Brian--?"

"The library is gone! The books that meant life or death for mankind
are a pile of crumbled ashes!"

       *       *       *       *       *

I suppose I should be grateful that we are here. I should be thankful
that Maureen's quick intelligence made it possible for us to land here
at the crater of Copernicus. I look from the window of my little shack.
I see shanties like my own arranged in a crude circle here at the base
of towering mountains.

Dr. Mallory was right. We have air here, and water. We have enough
provisions to last us for years. By the time those are exhausted, we
will be independent of our Earthly supplies, for already Sanders and
Van Huys have set soil into cultivation; they claim, gleefully, that
this thick, rich, Lunar soil flowers like a desert when watered. And we
have set up plants for the synthesis of water.

Strange how quickly we have adapted ourselves. We even laugh sometimes,
nowadays. There have been marriages; I suppose that means that in a
little while there will be births. Imagine that! The first Earth child
to be born on the Moon.

I, too, should be happy. At times I am--comparatively. For I have
Maureen beside me; our love is a great, sustaining force in a
desperate existence.

But I cannot be completely happy, for night or day I am reminded of
the great, impossible burden that weighs my shoulders low. The Earth,
a massive, glowing globe, lights our sky. Occasionally I think I can
glimpse the gleaming ocean waters of Earth; once, on a clear night, the
familiar outline of our lost homeland, America, was crystal clear to
our eyes.

Yet all life on that nearby mother planet is, must be, now deep in
everlasting sleep. Everlasting because I am powerless to interrupt it.
Because Mallory's library is no more; because I am a stupid soldier,
not a clever man.

Only recently there came a wan ray of hope. It was as we were
transferring the last pieces of furniture from the _Jefferson_ to
our shacks. In the berth that had been Danny Wilson's--gay, laughing
Danny!--I found pile upon pile of those amusing, colorful "magazines"
that Danny loved.

They are old and ragged; many of them are coverless. But most of
them--for such was Danny's preference--are the kind which Mallory once
called "science fiction." Dreams of the world-to-be, pathetic in the
face of that which now confronts us.

But it is my only ray of hope, these magazines. I brought them to my
shack. I am culling them carefully, one by one. There is a faint, and
oh! so faint, chance that....

Yet I fear it is a hopeless search. There is so much of fancy in
these little books, so little simple fact. Had but _one_ of those
imaginative writers of years ago thought to include in one of his
stories that which must have been, to him, a commonplace formula--that
for chlorophyll--I could yet do that which Mallory demanded of me. Here
we are rich with ores, the soil teems with every element known to man.
We have a well-equipped laboratory, we could synthesize _anything_. But
we cannot create this "chlorophyll" because we do not know what it is,
nor what elements combine to form it.

Hope dwindles as I read. There remains but one more slim pile of
magazines before me. If the answer is not in one of them, then we must
perish. I turn pleading eyes to the past, to the year 1940, before I
was born. But there is no one to hear my plea. Unless, in one of these
remaining--

                              POSTSCRIPT

Common sense tells me there can be little doubt but that this
"manuscript," purported to be written by one Brian O'Shea, a soldier in
the Army of the Democracies in the year 1963, A.D., is a deliberate and
painstaking hoax.

Who is responsible for it, I cannot begin to guess. Somehow I
can't bring myself to believe that Dr. Edgar Winslow (whom I have
investigated and found to be exactly what he claimed, a fellow in the
psychology department of one of our nearby Southern universities) would
lend himself to such a fantastic trick.

But it is hard to believe, also, that Winslow could and did achieve the
perfect telaesthetic rapport evidenced by the foregoing pages.

But--there was an earnestness about Winslow that stirred me strangely.
He did not have the air of a man perpetrating a fraud. He asked me, you
will remember, to "play the game of caution," even if I did not believe
that which I found in the manuscript.

I should, perhaps, dismiss the whole thing with a shrug; heave the
"story" back at Winslow with the advice that if he wants to become a
science-fiction writer he should do so honestly, not try to insinuate
his way into print on the byline of another.

Yet--it is a queer manuscript. It is quiet here in Roanoke today. As
I write, I look from my office windows to see the rolling hills, now
sweet-breasted with fresh green, misted with the soft white of dogwood.
The sky is blue and clear, the sun a warm beneficence. Still, the
morning papers tell of the desperate plight of the Allies. Again they
have lost ground to a grim, mechanized Totalitarian army. Finland,
Norway, Belgium, Holland,--the list grows.

Mussolini has sent his restless legions to battle; Japan makes overt
gestures toward the Indies. Russia, the patient bear, crouches in the
north, watches ... and waits....

I don't know. I honestly don't know. The manuscript is probably a hoax.
And yet ... and yet....

Anyway, here it is, Brian O'Shea. Here is what you asked for. You'll
find it on the cover of this magazine. If this magazine is one of those
through which you still have to search, the world you mourn may yet
blossom anew.

And because covers, like man's freedom and dreams and hopes, too often
crumble into dust, the formula you want is printed here again, man of
the future.

C_{55}H_{70}O_{6}N_{4}Mg is the empirical formula for chlorophyll,
Brian O'Shea!

C_{55}H_{70}O_{6}N_{4}Mg!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
