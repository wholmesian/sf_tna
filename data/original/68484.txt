                             THE STROLLER

                         By MARGARET ST. CLAIR

All sorts of things come in on a space freighter. Even in the old days
grocers were always finding twenty-foot pythons curled cozily inside
bunches of bananas from South America; and what sort of undesired
stowaways do you suppose you get when you have a cargo of tongarus
from south Venus, agatized Fyella corymbs from the district around
Aphrodition, hand-painted lumigraphs on goor fiber made in Marsport
prefecture, and golden rhnx jewelry from the canal centers?

George Saunders, supercargo of the _S.S. Trito_, gave his wife a warm
kiss on the cheek.

"For Pete's sake," he hissed into her ear, "act like you're glad to see
me, can't you? The Old Man's watching us."

Marta Saunders hesitated a moment and then threw her plump body into
her husband's arms.

"Oooh, Georgie!" she squealed. "You sweet old thing! It's so wonderful
to see you again!"

"That's enough," George rumbled warningly. He was swaying a little from
the impact. "Don't want to overdo it. Let's get out of here."

They started over to the parking area of the spaceport, where their
'copter was.

"What's the matter?" Marta demanded as soon as they were out of earshot
of the ship. "What do you care what the captain thinks about us?"

"Listen, Marta, the old fool's been riding me ever since we left
Aphrodition. Says I'm the most incompetent supercargo he's ever had.
Just before we docked today, he said he thought he'd take it up with
the union. If he does, you know what'll happen. Pynx said the last time
that if he got one more complaint about me he'd take the case to the
executive board. I'd lose my license, sure."

"Oh." Marta seemed unwillingly impressed. She got an atomizer out of
her handcase and began spraying quick-drying cosmi-lac over the skin of
her face and neck. "But what happened?" she asked an instant later when
the cosmetic had set. "Why's he so down on you?"

For a moment the fine-etched lines of irritation and petulance faded
from George Saunders' face, to be replaced by an expression of honest
perplexity.

"Marta, I--wait, here's the 'copter. I'll tell you about it after we
get in. And for the love of heaven, don't drop any pop bottles out of
the window the way you did the last time I was in port. Having the
air police after us would be the last straw, as far as my nerves are
concerned."

He slid into the driver's seat. Marta got two bottles of pop out of the
refrigerator, shoved straws into their necks, pulled a shelf out of the
paneling to hold one bottle at a convenient level under George's nose,
and began drinking out of the other herself.

"Well?" she asked after a couple of swallows.

George drank from his bottle before replying.

"It's the darnedest thing. I remember beginning to load number two
and three holds at Aphrodition, and I remember telling the longshore
leaderman to have the hatch covers put on again when the holds were
filled, but there're six or eight hours in there during the loading I
don't remember a single thing about. They're totally gone.

"Well, the way the ship handled at the take-off from Aphrodition, the
Old Man thought there must be something wrong, and when we were out in
space he went in for a look. Wow! I can see, sort of, why he's sore.
Those holds look like somebody'd stirred the things in 'em up with
a big stick. About a third of the cargo's ruined. The tongarus have
leaked all over those blasted lumigraphs, and--Well, the insurance
company is going to raise blue murder, and the owners won't like it one
little bit."

George licked his thin lips.

"What I want to know," he burst out, "is what _happened_ to me? I must
have told the longshoremen to load the holds like that, but--When we
were two days out of Venus, I asked Sparks (he's had a pre-medical
course, and he's saving up the tuition for medical school) to look me
over. He gave me all the tests, dozens of them, and finally told me
there wasn't a thing wrong with me mentally or physically except that I
needed more rest. Rest, bushwah! I've been sleeping ten hours a night,
and I wake up tireder than when I went to bed."

Marta studied him.

"You do look sort of tired," she observed. "Maybe you need some
vitor-ray treatments."

George ignored this comment.

"Of course, the Old Man's not such a bad guy," he said. "He never said
anything about that time I missed the ship at Marsport."

"You mean that time you were so drunk on soma? One of the times."

George gave an irritated shrug.

"Never mind that," he snapped. "I mentioned it because I asked him to
have dinner with us on Thursday, the day before we sail, and I want
you to have a real old-fashioned home-cooked meal for him. Maybe I can
soften him up. Have something nice for him. None of this complete meal
stuff out of the freezer--have something good. Out of cans."

"You mean like my canned crab and mushroom casserole?"

"Um-hum. Have that. And what's that dessert you make with the canned
peaches and the soma? pêche flambée, or something. He might like that."

       *       *       *       *       *

George set the 'copter down neatly on the roof of their apartment
house.

"Remember," he said, "I've got to make a good impression on him.
Flatter him as much as you can, but use your head about it. And if you
get any kind of a chance to tell him about how reliable I usually am,
do it."

The days moved on toward Thursday. George continued to complain of
fatigue, and on Tuesday night Marta woke up shrieking with a vague
and horrible nightmare, but it was attributed to indigestion; after
a dose of antiacid, she went back to sleep. On Wednesday she had her
hallucination.

She was putting a bunch of old digests and tabloids away in the closet
in the living room when she came across the jacket George had used four
or five years ago when he went grotch hunting.

"George!" she called. "Oh, George! Can I throw your old gray jacket
away? It's full of moth holes."

"What are you yelling at me for?" George asked irritably from behind
her. He had been sitting in his study, which was only about five feet
distant from the closet, drinking soma. "I'm right here."

Marta came out of the closet and stared at him. One hand went to her
heart. The pallor of her heavy, sagging face showed through her thick
face lacquer as a muddy gray.

"Wha--I saw you go into the kitchen!" she said. "You were wearing your
brown suit. I was looking right at you, and you walked the length of
the living room and went into the kitchen and closed the door behind
you. That's why I yelled at you. You were wearing your brown suit.
You've got the blue one on now. You were wearing your brown suit!"

"Shut up!" George said passionately. "Are you trying to drive me crazy?
I've been sitting right here all the time. What do you mean, you saw me
walk into the kitchen? You couldn't have. I've been sitting right here
all the time."

"But I saw you! You were wearing your brown suit."

"You imagined it!" her husband shrieked at her. "It's your imagination.
You shut up. What are you trying to do, get me so nervous the Old Man
will think I'm ready for the loony bin? You imagined it!"

Marta looked at him. She had to lick her lips twice before she could
answer.

"Yes. Yes, of course. That must be it. I imagined it."

George spent the rest of the day drinking soma and holding his hands
up before his eyes to see if they had stopped shaking. Marta got a
five-suit deck of cards out of the closet and played solitaire. None of
her games came out, but she was too distraught to realize that she had
left two of the cards inside their box.

       *       *       *       *       *

Surprisingly, both George and Marta slept well. They awakened far more
cheerful than they had been the night before. Even their pre-breakfast
snapping at each other lacked its usual note of bitter sincerity. When
Marta left the apartment and started out to do her shopping, she was
humming under her breath.

The canned crab was easy enough to locate, but she had to go to three
stores before she could find the peaches and the mushrooms. She ran
them to earth at last in a little grocery on a side street. Just as she
was leaving it, her eye caught the flash of a red label on a low shelf
near the door and she triumphantly dug out two cans of tomato soup.

"See what I got!" she said, showing her prize to George when she got
back home. "I guess I'm lucky or something. It's awfully hard to find."

"Gosh!" George shut off the video to give her his full attention.
"That's wonderful. I happen to know the Old Man's crazy about it. His
mother used to have it all the time. I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if it makes him change his mind completely about going to the union.
Marta, you're a smart girl."

Marta spent the rest of the day at the beauty shop, getting her hair
re-garnished with galoons and her face set. She wanted to make the
best possible impression on the captain. Around five-thirty she began
getting dinner--it doesn't take long to open cans--and an hour or so
later the Old Man (his name was Kauss) was chiming at the door.

Kauss was definitely stiff at first. He greeted Saunders with resentful
formality and gave Marta the merest flash of a smile before his face
grew hard again. When the fragrant steam from the tureen of tomato soup
Marta was bringing in blew toward him, he relaxed somewhat, and the
salad of canned string beans, onions, lettuce and mayonnaise softened
him still more. By the time he had finished two big helpings of Marta's
crab casserole, it began to look like the job was saved. He offered
George a cigar and began telling him a long story about what the
little Martian hostess at the Silver Weetarete had said to him.

Marta went out in the kitchen to fix the pêche flambée. She cut sponge
cake into neat rounds, spread disks of hard-frozen banana ice cream
over them, and crowned the structure on each dessert plate with half
of an enormous canned clingstone peach. From a bottle she poured soma
carefully over each of the peaches, set a bit of paper to burning by
pressing it against the element in the atomic range, and then used the
paper to ignite the soma on the peaches.

"George!" she called in the direction of the dining apse. "Oh, George,
honey, help me with the plates!"

She heard him come in. She turned at his step, ready to pick up the
plates, one in each hand, and give them to him.

He was wearing his brown suit.

But--he was wearing the green one today, wasn't he, because it was the
best suit he had and he wanted to impress the captain. His green--his
green--

George's face slipped down toward the fourth button on his coat. It
wavered, solidified, flowed back into place, and then slopped down over
his lapels once more. Suddenly it solidified into a sort of tentacle.
It came falteringly toward Marta, half-blind, but purposive.

Marta tried to scream. Her throat was too constricted by terror to let
out more than a mere thread of sound, but it had carrying power. George
and Kauss, out in the dining apse, heard it.

They came running in. Kauss was quick-witted. He picked up one of the
plates with the soma burning on it and hurled it straight at the thing
that was wearing George's clothes.

There was an explosion, so loud that the plexiglass in the windows
bulged outward for a moment, and then a bright, instant column of
flame. Then nothing. George's brown suit lay collapsed and empty on the
floor.

[Illustration: There was an explosion so loud the plexiglass windows
bulged outward for a moment.]

"It was wearing your suit, George," Marta said hysterically. She was
leaning back against the wall, looking faint and sick. "George, it was
wearing your suit. Oh, what was it, what was it, anyway?"

Kauss was looking at the debris on the floor. A peculiar expression,
half satisfaction, half private insight, hovered around the corners of
his lips.

"It was a Mocker, I think," he answered.

"A Mocker? What--?"

"Um-hum. You still find a few of them in the wilder parts of Venus.
They're parasitic--ah--entities, that feed on the life force, as well
as the flesh, of human beings. No doubt this one came aboard the
ship at Aphrodition, in that consignment of Fyella corymbs. They're
invisible most of the time, so of course we didn't suspect it."

"But how did it get here?" George demanded. "Why did it pick on Marta
as a victim?"

"Well, you see the usual way a Mocker works is to select someone as
a host, as a sort of base of operations, and then range out from him
whenever it wants to eat. For some reason, whenever it leaves its host,
it takes on his features and body and dresses itself in his clothes.
That's what happened here. One of the first signs that a Mocker is
taking hold is a spell of amnesia, and of course that's what happened
to you, Saunders, when we were taking on cargo at Aphrodition, though I
didn't realize it at the time.

"A Mocker doesn't usually kill its host directly, but it does draw
on his life force to keep itself going, and he usually complains of
feeling worn out and tired."

       *       *       *       *       *

Kauss halted. Marta looked down at her husband's brown suit and the ice
cream slowly melting across it.

"Please, George, pick up that stuff before it ruins your suit
completely," she said automatically. And then, to Kauss, "But what
happened when you threw the plate at it? What happened? Oh, I was so
scared!"

"Yes, the Mockers are terrifying." Kauss agreed. He seemed to square
his broad shoulders. "However, at bottom they are unintelligent--look
at the stupidity of this one in attacking you when your husband and I
were in the next room--and they are really not especially dangerous
provided you know the defense against them.

"You see, their body structure, while based on the same elements as
our own, involves large quantities of free hydrogen between the body
cells. Hydrogen ignites in ordinary air with explosive force--the end
product's water--and when I threw that burning stuff at the creature,
the hydrogen in its tissues exploded. It blew up. There's probably
a good deal more water vapor in the air in this room than there was
before I got rid of the thing."

Kauss cleared his throat.

"There's another life form," he said with a faintly professional air,
"allied to the Mocker, but with important differences, which is far
more dangerous. That's the Stroller."

"The Stroller?" Marta asked. George had put his arm around her; they
were not an affectionate couple, but the moment seemed to call for
tender demonstration. "Why do they call it that?"

"No one knows, exactly. It seems to come from the creature's own name
for itself, for its fondness for taking long, long, walks."

Kauss turned the cigar in his mouth. He poked at the suit lying on the
floor with the toe of his shoe.

"What does _it_ do?" Marta queried. "Why is it so terribly dangerous?"

"The Stroller doesn't hunt a host, like the Mocker," Kauss replied.
"Early in life it takes over the identity of some human being, and it
remains indistinguishable from a human being to any usual test. It's
so dangerous because there's absolutely no defense against it. No free
hydrogen in _its_ tissues. It's indestructible."

"My!" Marta said. "Goodness!"

"It feeds, like the Mocker, on both the flesh and the life force of
human beings. Fortunately"--Kauss smiled--"it's very, very rare. There
are probably only a few Strollers in the entire solar system, and they
reproduce only at widely separated intervals."

Once more Kauss halted and poked absently at the clothing on the floor
with the toe of his boot.

"There's a peculiarity about their feeding habits," he said. "They'll
go for years without feeling any desire to eat their special food, and
then something will happen which makes them--greedy, and after that
they can't be stopped before they feed."

"Goodness!" Marta said again. She hid a nervous yawn behind her hand.
"George, get me a chair, will you? I'd like to sit down." To Kauss, she
said. "How did you find out all these things? You must have made quite
a study of the subject. Why, I've read several books about Venus, and I
listen to all the casts on the video about it, but I never heard either
of these creatures mentioned before. It seems to be a sort of hobby of
yours."

George pushed a kitchen chair out for her; she sat down with a sigh of
relief.

"Not a hobby," Kauss corrected gently.

His face began to waver and flow as the Mocker's had done. Then it
snapped back into place.

He licked his lips very delicately.

"You see, I'm a Stroller myself. And, somehow, I'm feeling that I'd
like to eat."

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
