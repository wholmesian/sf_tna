                           THE RHIZOID KILL

                            By JACK BRADLEY

             _Rhizoids--fabulous gems that harnessed every
        brilliant sun of the Galaxy--these were the kill-stones
              that sent space rat Mallard racing for the
           forbidden swamp belt of Mercury ... into a lurid
           land that beckoned the get-rich-quick riff-raff._

The first half mile into the swamp hadn't been so bad, but now Mallard
began to feel really afraid. There were things in here that no spaceman
had ever seen and against some of them the small blaster on his hip
would be about as effective as a popgun.

A little way ahead of him, he could dimly see the naked body of the
Mercurian swamp girl and he swore enviously at the way she slipped
through the dense fern growth, her webbed feet gripping the mud firmly.
Once she held up her hand warningly and he slipped down behind a fallen
tree fern to let a huge plant slug glide past. The thing was nearly
forty feet in length and it could move with the speed of an express
train.

When it was gone, he got up and followed the swamp girl again. He
hugged the helmet to him closer and grinned at the feel of the strange
metal in his hands. That helmet was his one last chance for all the
things he had ever wanted and he would hold on to it as long as he had
life left. With that helmet he could be free of Bill Olger and D'ulio,
the Martian, and go back to Earth with more wealth than a space rat
like himself had ever brought back. It was now, he reflected, one month
from the night he had met them, back in Venusport....

Mallard was sitting at a table in the Green Star the night they came
in. Sitting there, drinking Sre, the raw native wine, and wondering if
he could afford another glass of the stuff. He was surrounded by the
riff-raff of the spaceways and his nerves were raw from a week-long
bout with the Sre.

The two men came in, looked the dingy place over for a moment, then
made directly for his table. They were both big men, the Earth man a
red-haired giant with the cold eyes and the hard, ruthless face of
the space rat. Mallard had come to know plenty of men like him since
he had been kicked out of the Patrol. Hard, bitter men, shrewd and
utterly conscienceless. The Martian beside him he hardly noticed.
His red, skeleton-like face was the typical Martian mask and Mallard
wasted no time trying to form an estimate of him. No Earth man ever
would know what a Martian was like until he'd lived beside him for
years--sometimes not even then. And, anyway, Mallard wasn't too
interested in either of them. Not even when they came over and sat at
his table.

"I'm Bill Olger," the Earth man began without preliminaries. "This
is my friend, D'ulio, one of the smartest scientists Mars has ever
produced. We know about you. You're George Mallard, owner of the Space
Lark."

"If you're getting ready to make a touch you can save your breath,"
Mallard said sourly. "I haven't got a hundred credits to my name."

"We're not getting ready to make a touch, Mallard," Olger said. "We're
getting ready to let you in on the chance of a lifetime. Now, do you
want to let us buy you a drink of something decent while we tell you
about it, or would you rather keep on sitting here alone drinking this
slop?"

Mallard looked from his hard face to the spidery red mask of the
Martian, then shrugged his shoulders and pushed out his empty glass.
Olger beckoned to the Venusian waiter and presently Mallard was sipping
a glass of pale green brandy that soothed his raw nerves like the
almost forgotten touch of an Earth woman's hands. Bill Olger yanked his
chair closer and bent his head over the table.

"Look, Mallard, I'm not going to beat around the bush with you. I've
kept pretty close tabs on you since you were kicked out of the Patrol
and I know you're at the end of your rope. You've been picked up twice
by the Patrol, on suspicion of piracy and, both times, you got away by
the skin of your teeth. So our proposition is made to order for you,
if you've got as much nerve as I think you have. The proposition is
rhizoids."

Mallard whistled softly. Rhizoids! Those incredible gems brought back
from the fringes of the impenetrable swamp belt of Mercury. Gems that
grew, layer upon layer, like a pearl growing within an oyster, in the
heart of a fungus shrub that looked like a dead, white stump. There
were less than a dozen of those gems in all the Galaxy and they were
worth upwards of a hundred thousand credits each.

Mallard had seen one only once and that had been at a distance. It was
worn by a Martian desert queen and he had never forgotten the exquisite
beauty of the thing. Even yards away he could see the sultry fires
imprisoned in that incredible stone and it made every other jewel he
had ever seen look like a piece of cheap cut glass.

"Sounds very nice, Olger," he said slowly. "There's just one little
catch to it. The fungus stumps where those things grow are loaded with
spores and those spores are the deadliest things in all the System. A
friend of mine, First Mate on the Jupiter run, went on an expedition to
bring back some of those rhizoids a few years back and he told me what
it was like.

"They wear glassite suits while they're hacking the stumps apart to
get at the rhizoids. The instant one of those stumps is touched it
sends out a fine cloud of spores and when those spores settle down on
a glassite suit it looks like the man was covered by hoar frost. They
throw the suits away when they leave the scene.

"One of the men, this mate said, happened to step on a piece of one of
those stumps, after he'd gotten out of his glassite suit. I got kind of
sick listening to the mate tell about what happened then. Ever see an
Earth wasp sting another insect and then lay its eggs in that insect's
body, Olger? Well, it was like that. The man was paralyzed the minute
the spores settled on him and he started screaming. A couple of minutes
and the spores had paralyzed his vocal chords and after that he stopped
screaming. He--well, he just kept screaming with his eyes, the mate
said. They put a blaster to the poor devil's head before they left.

"That's what those spores are like, Olger, and I don't want any part of
them, thanks. I don't mind taking a chance on dying from a ray gun but
those rhizoids are only worth a hundred thousand credits apiece and I'd
want a hundred million before I'd take a chance on dying like that."

"And what if we could show you a chance to make your hundred million?"
Bill Olger asked softly.

Mallard's fingers tightened around his glass. "I'm listening."

"You see," Olger began slowly, "the trouble up to now has been that
no one could get those stones out of the fungus stumps unless he was
protected by a cumbersome glassite suit and the swamp belt is too dense
to bring those suits into. That meant they could only pick up a few
they found growing around the rim of the belt. There are rumors that
the natives have found a way to handle the spores but they regard the
fungus as sacred and won't help.

"But, a couple of years back the Galactic Colonization Board finally
managed to get one of the plants back to Earth. It isn't generally
known but they really did it. They used a low powered force field and
finally worked it into a glassite cage. They kept it quiet because they
lost three of their men getting the thing caged.

"When they got the fungus stump back to Earth they began to experiment
with it. They started coating white rats with different chemicals and
coverings, or injecting different drugs in them, and then sending them
into the cage with the thing. They used up an awful lot of white rats,
Mallard."

George Mallard shuddered. "I can believe that."

"The main thing, though, the thing that matters to us, is that they put
D'ulio, here, in charge of the experiments. And D'ulio had ideas of his
own. He was just out of the Martian University and he just couldn't see
any point in working for Terrans for the rest of his life for a small
salary.

"The second week D'ulio worked on the fungus stump he discovered
that the spores could be killed as fast as they were released by a
plain, ordinary Overton ray. You remember the old Overton ray gun that
was used in the war against the Martian desert tribes? The gun was
originally meant to be rigged up on a ship but D'ulio made a smaller
model that could be carried by two men and it worked on the spores as
well as a big gun.

"As soon as D'ulio was sure of his findings he opened the fungus stump,
took out the rhizoid from it, then 'accidentally' burned the stump to a
crisp. He reported that there was no rhizoid inside it. Sometimes they
don't have, you know, just as lots of pearls don't happen to be there
when you open the oyster. He was fired for his carelessness. As soon as
it was safe he contacted me. He knew I had ways of getting rid of the
rhizoid that he didn't have. So, here we are. D'ulio has the equipment
we need. We have the money to finance the expedition--and you have the
ship. What do you say, Mallard?"

"It would take the best part of fifty thousand credits to get the Space
Lark ready for a trip like that," Mallard said doubtfully.

"And I've got twice that, right here in my pocket, chum." Bill Olger
reached into his pocket and handed something to Mallard under cover of
the table. Something that was smooth and round and hard. Mallard held
it below the level of the table top and looked. Then he drew in his
breath as sharply as if he had been hit in the stomach.

At first glance, the thing looked like a large and very perfect Terran
fire opal. But no opal ever gleamed with the unbelievably sultry fires
that lived in this stone. It looked as though every sun of the Galaxy
were imprisoned within its depths. George Mallard looked at the rhizoid
in his hand for a moment longer, then turned to Bill Olger. When he
spoke, his voice was shaky.

"We can be ready to blast off in forty-eight hours."

       *       *       *       *       *

The Swamp Belt of Mercury! Mallard looked at the almost impenetrable
growth of tangled fern trees and undergrowth and swore wearily. They
had been here for three weeks, now, and it had been three weeks of
pure, unadulterated hell. The dank, steamy air made every breath a
painful effort and, day and night, giant insects made their life
miserable. They could take the miniature Overton ray gun a little way
into the swamp belt but at every step they had to be on the alert for
the great reptiles that floundered through the dense undergrowth. And
even more, for the deadly plant life that lay in wait.

And always they were under watch from the natives. Scaly-hided men,
not much past the anthropoid stage, but the crude wooden spears they
used could be very dangerous. The Overton ray gun was scaled down to
near zero for use against the fungus stumps but it could be turned up
to full power for its original use as a weapon. And the gun had saved
their lives on more than one occasion when those wooden spears began to
fly past them. It was a tense, miserable life.

But they did find the rhizoids. Not as many as they had hoped for,
because the Overton gun could be taken into the swamp belt only a
little way, but they found far, far more than had ever been brought out
before. Day after day the tiny hoard of stones grew. Night after night
the three men sat around the cabin of the Space Lark, gloating over
them. At least Bill Olger and the Martian D'ulio did. Only Mallard was
sullen and dissatisfied. Once he put his feelings into words.

"Look. You two are all steamed up because we've got a handful of these
things. A handful that's got to be divided three ways. Do you know
how long your share's going to last once you hit the bright lights in
Venusport? Well, I'll tell you. A year, two years. Maybe three years
if you're careful. You might be satisfied with that but I'm not. Me, I
want those hundreds of millions we were talking about when we started
this thing. Yes, and if I can figure out some way of getting further
into this damned swamp I'll get them, too."

Olger looked at him in unconcealed disgust. "I can understand a man
being a bum loser, Mallard, but not a bum winner. You know that we've
already gone as far into the swamp belt as we can with the Overton and
if you think I'm going into that hellhole without the ray gun, you're
crazy. It makes my skin crawl to think of the narrow escapes we've had,
even with it. Be reasonable, fella."

Mallard nodded glumly. He knew, of course, that Olger was right, but
the nightly sight of the rhizoids, softly gleaming in his hands, was
raising a fever in his brain that would not be stilled. If there was
only some way to establish contact with the natives, maybe get a guide.
He fondled the rhizoid in his fingers and stared thoughtfully at the
sultry fires within its depths.

The next day he started making overtures to a native girl they had
dubbed Tiny. The natives they had seen flitting about the swamp seemed
to average around seven feet tall but Tiny was not much larger than
an Earth girl. She seemed very young, barely out of her childhood,
although they had no way of knowing the age of these natives. Like
youngsters of any race, she was filled with curiosity and she often
hung around the outskirts of the camp after her tribesmen had been
driven away.

Mallard set to work winning her confidence the same way he would have
done with a wild animal. The first time she was alone he squatted down
on the ground and made encouraging sounds toward the fern tree behind
which she hid. Then he took a piece of Earth candy from his pocket,
nibbled at it, made sounds of delight, and threw it on the ground
before her. He walked away and when he looked back and saw her pick up
the candy, he knew that he had made a start. In another two days, he
was squatting on the ground, a few feet from her, trying to learn the
rudiments of her language.

It was no easy task he had set for himself. Her language was a series
of barking consonants that were terribly hard for his Terran vocal
chords to form and her thought processes were so primitive that it was
like trying to talk to a four-year-old child in a strange language.

But he did progress to the point where he could communicate simple
ideas to her. Then he made the mistake of telling her that he wanted
to find more of the rhizoid bearing fungus. Many, many more of them.
When she understood what he wanted, she ran away and he did not see her
again for nearly a week.

And when he did see her again it was almost too late for her to be of
any further use to him. He was prospecting alone, that day, Olger and
D'ulio having set out to explore another section of the swamp belt. He
had gone only a little way into the swamp when he saw Tiny struggling,
half mad with fear, in the grip of two burly natives. They were tying
her with vines to a fallen log and another native was coming forward,
carrying something in his arms.

Suddenly Mallard swore incredulously. The third native was carrying one
of the white fungus stumps in his arms, carrying that deadly thing as
carelessly as he would have carried a stick of wood! And then Mallard
saw that he was wearing a helmet on his head, a metal helmet, ringed by
some sort of crystal stones. The helmet was pouring a protective flood
of soft green light downward, completely covering the native's body. He
seemed unharmed by the green light but the spores from the fungus stump
were shriveling the instant they were touched by the light.

Mallard leaped forward, then, his blaster spitting wildly. His first
shot brought down the native with the helmet and the other two went
down a moment later. When he rushed forward and took the helmet off the
dead native, Tiny cowered down on the ground, her child eyes rolling
up fearfully at him. Mallard ignored her as he bent his head over the
helmet.

The thing was made of some purplish metal that was like nothing he
had ever seen anywhere in the System. Certainly it had never been
constructed by these primitive people and Mallard wondered briefly what
alien race from what far distant star had left it here in these fetid
swamps.

But he was too filled with wild exultation to waste much time in idle
speculation. The thing that mattered was that he now had a really
perfect device for getting out the rhizoids. He alone had it! Let Olger
and D'ulio keep their cumbersome Overton ray gun and squirm around the
edge of the swamp belt with it. With this thing he could go deep inside
the belt and bring out all the rhizoids he could carry.

And he was savagely determined to keep them when he brought them out.
Let Bill Olger and D'ulio go back with him, carrying a basketful of
those wonderful stones? Why, within hours after they hit Venusport,
half the riff-raff of the space lanes would know about their discovery
and be heading for Mercury. No, when he lifted the Space Lark off
Mercury, Olger and the Martian simply wouldn't be aboard. The thought
of murder raised no particular horror in his brain. He had killed
before. He whirled about and looked down at the cowering native girl.

"You--belong me--now. You--take me--to these."

He showed her a couple of the rhizoids. Tiny looked back at the swamp
behind her and whimpered like a beaten puppy just once. Then she nodded
her head slowly. Mallard grinned with satisfaction as he bent down to
cut her loose.

       *       *       *       *       *

The girl led Mallard back into the very heart of the swamp belt. The
journey was sheer nightmare. Hour after hour they plodded on while
Mallard's body was soaked with sweat and his lungs seemed ready to
burst from the steamy air. But the feel of those stones in his pocket
somehow kept him plodding along after the naked girl ahead of him.
Those stones had magic in them.

It seemed long eons before he saw Tiny come to a halt and looked
fearfully around her. From her evident fright, Mallard guessed she
was in a taboo place. She made a furtive gesture and he hurried up to
her. He reached the spot where she stood and drew in his breath with a
shuddering gasp.

The swamp had thinned out at this point and there before him was a
whole grove of the white fungus stumps! They stood in serried ranks,
like a yardful of ghosts and Mallard knew that within those white
stumps there was a fortune that no space rat had ever dreamed of before.

He broke into a stumbling run forward, the girl completely forgotten.
At the edge of the grove he paused only a moment to make sure the
shielding light of the helmet was properly adjusted. Then he swung his
blade down upon one of the white stumps. It split easily and he drew
forth a perfect rhizoid, larger than any they had found so far. For
a moment he held it shakily in his hand. Then he slipped it into the
leather pouch he carried on his belt.

In little more than an hour Mallard had filled the pouch he carried. He
was working like a madman, now, the sweat pouring from him in torrents,
and he was numb with fatigue but the fever in his brain swept away all
thoughts of stopping.

He wanted more of these gleaming stones. He wanted to fill his pockets
with them, carry them away in his cupped hands. He was still moving
forward on tottering feet when he heard Tiny scream. He whirled about
savagely, his hand darting to the small blaster at his belt.

A tangled horde of Mercurian warriors was pouring out of the swamp into
the clearing. Their bestial faces were twisted with rage and their
wooden spears raised menacingly. Even as Mallard turned and sprinted
back, those wooden spears were flying past his head. He ducked down
behind a log, the native girl crouched, whimpering like a puppy, beside
him.

Mallard put the helmet and the bag of rhizoids down beside him and
began picking off the scaly-hided warriors, one by one. He fired
carefully, anxious to conserve the remaining charges in his small hand
blaster. In his mind was a new dread.

He knew that, long ago, Bill Olger and the Martian would have returned
to the Space Lark and found him gone. They would immediately set out
looking for him and the sound of this fight would draw them to him.
They must not find him with his pouch full of rhizoids! Never would he
share those stones with any one else, that much he knew.

Suddenly he saw something that caused him to open his eyes in stark
disbelief. One of the warriors in that milling throng was wearing
another helmet, an exact duplicate of the one lying beside him. And he
was carrying a fragment from one of those deadly fungus stumps in his
hands! Holding it ready to hurl the moment he was close.

Mallard started to put on his own helmet, then realized that in his
prone position it would not shield him. He let it lie and started
firing more rapidly, trying to reach the wearer of that helmet. He
ducked aside as one of the spears barely missed him and heard a moan of
anguish from the girl beside him. One of the spears had gone into her
side and blood was pouring from the wound.

From out in the swamp, there was the sound of signal shots, followed
by loud shouts. It was Olger and D'ulio and they were not far away.
Mallard began firing at top speed, now, and the Mercurians fell like
tenpins. The moaning girl beside him he ignored. And then the whole
action exploded into nightmare.

The Mercurian with the helmet stepped forward and called out a
peremptory command to the girl. And she answered! Snatching up the
pouch of rhizoids, she jumped clear of the log and started hobbling
painfully toward her own people. At the same moment, Mallard saw big
Olger and D'ulio leap out into the clearing, guns drawn.

For one long moment, Mallard stared in horrified fascination at the
girl carrying away the thing that mattered more than life itself to
him. Then he had leaped clear of the log and was sprinting after her.
As in a slow motion picture, he saw Olger and D'ulio firing into the
tangled mass and saw the helmeted Mercurian warrior raise the fragment
of deadly white fungus.

For just a split part of a second he started to turn, to jump back and
reach that protective helmet behind the log. But the limping girl was
so close. Only another step. He reached forward for the leather pouch
and the fungus landed directly at his feet!

A cloud of fine spores lifted up like a puff of smoke and Mallard
felt pain greater than he had ever known man could experience. He
felt himself falling, literally pulled to the ground by the wave of
pain that was tightening every muscle in his body into an individual
agonized knot. From a long way off he heard some one screaming and knew
that it was his own voice.

Mallard was no longer conscious of the action all around him. True, he
could dimly sense the horde of scaly-hided Mercurians rushing panic
stricken past him and he could hear that monotonous screaming that was
his own voice. But the only thing that really existed for him was the
hundreds of knots of agony in his own paralyzed body.

The only thing? From the corner of his eyes he could see the pouch of
rhizoids lying almost touching him and he tried to force his agonized
body into one last effort to cover it before he called out to Olger
and the Martian to put the helmet on him. That helmet would stop
the searing pain, yes, but if only he could hold out for one moment
longer--just one moment. Long enough to hide those glorious gems with
his body--

He tried and found that he could not move one inch. He gave up the
effort and drew in one last breath to call out to them, to tell them to
put the helmet on him.

And he could not speak! The poison of the spores had already reached
his vocal chords.

He was still screaming with his eyes when the others came up to him.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
