REGENERATION


*So long as there are men and women alive, in a livable environment, then
                      a new beginning is possible.*

by Charles Dye


    *It has been truly stated that those who fail to learn and
    understand history, are condemned to repeat history!*


       [Illustration: For those in the cities, it was the end....]

               For those in the cities, it was the end....


_It was bound to happen sooner or later._

_Not because man failed to understand his fellow man, but because he
failed to understand himself._

_There wasnât much left afterwards--after the golden showers of deadly
dust and the blinding flashes that blotted out the light from the sun._

_And all because man continued to confuse emotion with reason._

_But somehow, as before, man survived...._



"_Donât touch!_" Sinzorâs command shot through the chill morning air like
an arrow.

The ragged little group of men stopped dead in their tracks and looked
questioningly at their leader. He was pointing down to an object lying
half-buried in the soil at his feet.

"Another _death-thing_, maybe," Sinzor said. "Another _âthing_ our
ancestors made with which to destroy themselves." He peered around the
semi-circle of men until he spotted the aged one with a leg missing.
"Morge! See that this place is marked forbidden." The hunting party moved
on and Morge stayed behind. He hobbled about, collecting sticks and
stones, arranging them in the "forbidden-symbol" way to form a barrier
around the _âthing_. It was because of such a _âthing_ that heâd lost a
leg in his youth. He both hated and feared the _death-things_ his
ancestors had so carelessly left lying about before they vanished. But
that wasnât right. Morge scratched his grizzly old head and thought hard.
According to Builder, wisest of their tribe, their ancestors hadnât all
vanished; some of them had become the tribe--Sinzor, Builder, and even old
Morge. Very puzzling. But it was all because of the _death-things_!

Puffing, Morge completed the barrier, then turned for a last look at the
_âthing_ gleaming dully in the pale winter sunlight. How strange it
looked. In no way did it resemble the usual _death-things_, most of which
were long and round with little wings attached. This one was different,
like nothing heâd ever seen before. It was boxlike with strange arms
sticking up; and under the arms, half-buried, was a shelf or platform
resembling vaguely the upper portion of two legs. The _âthing_ terrified
Morge for a moment; then, in order to prove his courage to himself, he
stepped forward and spat on it. Nothing happened. Sneering, he spat on it
again and watched his spittle slowly run down its side over a strange
marking like a thunderbolt--

Thunderbolt!

Suddenly Morge fell grovelling to his one good knee. It was Thor, god of
thunder and lightning and god of the tribe!

_And he had spat on Thor!_



For nearly an hour he knelt there praying forgiveness for his sacrilege.
Then, trembling, he tore off a piece of his goatskin and wiped the spittle
off Thorâs side, carefully began to uncover the remainder of Thor.

Finally he lifted Thor out of the hole and onto level ground. Kneeling
once more, he took a small drink-scoop from his belt and placed it before
Thor. Then he pulled out his knife and folded his single leg under him;
bending over, he cut a gash in his wrist and let the blood flow into the
scoop until it was nearly full.

Rising to his knee he said, "Oh, Thor, please take this humble offering to
show that I am forgiven." Almost prostrate now, he picked up the scoop and
placed it on Thorâs lap beneath his arms.

Immediately there was a soft rumble and humming. Fearfully old Morge
watched Thorâs arms come down, lift up the scoop and carry it inside his
huge mouth. There was a sucking noise and the scoop was returned empty to
his lap.

Filled with joy, Morge spent another endless time thanking Thor. Then all
of a sudden an idea seized him. What if he carried Thor back to the tribe
and presented him to the priest, Thougor, for all to worship and give
sacrifices to? Would not he, the despised, the looked down upon, be the
greatest of heroes? All that was known of Thor were the legends, but at
last they would have the actual god!

Painfully, with many grunts and groans, he got Thor under one arm and
staggered off towards the village, his crutch kicking up little puffs of
dust.



Builder was having trouble with Thougor.

He almost wished now that heâd continued his search a little longer for a
segment of humanity. He might have found a group less primitive who would
have appreciated and understood his help much better. But this was the
best heâd found; as it was, heâd wandered over the continent nearly a
lifetime before even finding these poor wretches. But they were at least
human--something that couldnât be said for those _others_ heâd come in
contact with all through the past years.

And now, after having been with the tribe--the only human tribe--for over
a year, he was being balked by this--priest! Which meant being balked at
setting up Truth and Knowledge as the only true gods of humanity, being
balked at getting the dam built before the spring rains, so that there
would not be another summer drouth followed by a winter of famine such as
they had just passed through. The dam was his first big project; without
freedom from want, there would be little progress next winter.

Almost savagely he turned on Thougor. "But why must you have this
religious festival _now_?"

"Because of the finding of the god Thor," came Thougorâs cold answer.

"Why the offerings of blood? Canât they wait? The dam _must_ be finished
before the rains; but the loss of blood already has so weakened the
workers that they can no longer work for a full day."

"Which is more important, worldly or spiritual things?" Thougor replied.

"But there maybe wonât be anyone around to indulge in spiritual things if
thereâs another drouth this year!"

"Thor will see to it that there is not another drouth."

"Yes, I know, but wouldnât it be wiser to be on the safe side? Suppose
somebody does something to displease Thor?"

"Nobody will displease Thor! It is my duty to see to that! I tell them
what to think, so that they wonât displease Thor."

_A crafty devil you are_, Builder thought. _Manipulating this image of
Thor you talk about, so that it will take the blood offerings of the
people and even you and that half-baked discipline of yours, Morge. I must
look at your god Thor one of these days--_

He suddenly felt very weary and sat down on the floor; looking up at
Thougor, he said, "But that is not part of being civilized, to tell the
people _what_ to think. You must _make_ them think without telling them
what to think. And with the dam, next winter there will be freedom from
want for the first time. The tribe will have a chance to think and be on
the road to civilization."

"The tribe has already found civilization in finding Thor. By worshipping
Him as a group they have already ceased their bickering and quarreling.
Does not that fit in with your definition of civilization, the one you
gave my people when you first came to us? Since the coming of Thor we have
begun to cooperate, have we not?"

"No, hardly at all. I said civilization is cooperation among men in
adapting to environment--which includes man."

The two men stared at each other, and for awhile there was silence.

"Nevertheless," Thougor finally said, "Thor and blood offerings continue!"



Builder watched Thougor turn and stalk out of the tiny hovel that housed
his plans and his work, himself and his dreams. What could he do? He could
only appeal to the tribeâs reason; Thougor could appeal to their emotions
which were far stronger. But unless emotion was controlled, used wisely,
there could never be any reason.

Builder realized, with a sinking heart, that he was much too old for the
job heâd undertaken. Too late in life had he discovered these people.
Almost all his energy since youth had been sapped just looking for a
segment of humanity. His mother and father had told him there might be
failure, but still they had taught him everything they could in the short
time before death had overtaken them. They had been the only humans living
in that towering jungle of concrete and steel. How they had gotten there
was never explained to him. It didnât matter, though.

Suddenly Builder shook himself. Here he was recollecting his youth instead
of concentrating on the task at hand. He must _really_ be getting old.

He was glad of Thougorâs visit. At least he was now fully aware of the
problem to be solved. In spite of the priest, he had to find a way of
getting that dam finished and soon. Or maybe next year there wouldnât be
any people, for game was getting scarcer each winter.



Very little work was done that day in spite of Builderâs managing to round
up his full crew. The blood offering each worker had given the night
before had left them tired and listless. Only four of the fifty-four molds
running across the river were filled with sand and gravel that morning and
afternoon--there were still nearly fifty to be filled. Builder was very
depressed--

But he was even more depressed when, at the close of day, two workmen grew
careless and slipped into the last mold being filled; their ear-splitting
shrieks brought half the tribe up over the hill above the village and down
to the dam sight.

After Builder explained what had happened, there were angry mutterings to
the effect that Thor was displeased with the dam and therefore had taken
lives. Nothing Builder could say would dissuade them from this notion, so
well had Thougor indoctrinated them with religious fear of anything used
to control nature. Builder hadnât realized until that moment just how much
the people were against the dam.

Then he saw Thougor, tall and ominous in his cloak of black skins, come
striding through the crowd.

For a moment he stood facing them with his hands on his hips. There seemed
to be a silent understanding between them. Slowly the crowd turned and
disappeared over the hill.

Then Thougor strode over to Builder and said simply, "There will be no
more dam." Turning he followed the rest of the tribe back to the village.

Builder was thunderstruck. He knew there was no use arguing or trying to
reason with either Thougor or the tribe. It was too late for that; only
some drastic measure would complete the dam now.

He walked tiredly over the black hill and down to his shack, wondering how
he could compete with an idol. He realized now, it had been foolish of him
to have overlooked the possible effect Thor might have upon the tribe.
When it had been found three months ago, he never dreamed they would spend
all their leisure in rituals.

The god was his problem; therefore he must get it out of the way, himself,
without expecting help from anyone. Each evening the clouds on the
northern horizon were darkening and drawing closer.



It was night when Builder finally stumbled into his quarters. After
lighting a pine torch he sat down by his workbench and buried his head in
his hands. He was too tired and upset to eat, which was just as well--

Outside of deliberately killing Thougor, there was only one thing he could
do--that was to kidnap Thor. With this realization, in spite of the risk
involved, came some peace of mind. He hadnât the vaguest idea just how he
was to go about it, especially since his strength was failing him, but do
it he would. First, though, he would have to wait until sometime before
dawn when everybody--even Thougor--was sure to be asleep.

The hours dragged heavily between then and his chosen time. Many were the
times when he longed for something to read, although he supposed that by
this time heâd forgotten how. Like wisps of smoke, memories of his youth
in the concrete jungle drifted through his mind. How long ago that all
seemed now. Sometimes he wondered if any of it had been real. But here he
was, as his parents had wished him to be, trying to help what was left of
humanity back up the trail. To what, he wondered? To destruction
again--this time, probably complete and final?

He shook his old head and ran a trembling hand through his white shaggy
hair. Heâd gotten this far; somehow he would get the rest of the way.

Builder got up and crossed over to his sleeping pile. After tying several
skins together, he folded them under his arm and walked out into the
pre-dawn night. His bones felt the crackling cold of early spring as they
had never felt it before. Slowly he made his way around the village to
where Thor was housed under a huge slanting roof of bark and scraped
skins. Heâd never seen Thor, and now wished heâd paid at least one visit
to the god.

Like a shadow he glided carefully through the blackness in back of the
temple until he was just inside the rear opening. He could see clear
across the chamber, out into the pale twinkling stars. Then he detected a
dark mass in the center of the temple silhouetted against the stars; that
must be Thor.

Swiftly Builder advanced towards it until his foot struck something soft,
causing him to stumble and fall. As he did so, he heard a grunt sounding
like someone being kicked in the stomach--

Then something was on top of him, pounding his head and shoulders with a
heavy stick of some kind. Old Builder knew he didnât have the strength to
wrestle; he managed to get his pile of skins unfolded and, with his last
ounce of strength, throw them over the head of his attacker. Somehow he
managed to wiggle out from underneath and climb to his feet. His assailant
began to scream for help, but the heavy skins muffled his shouts.

Quickly Builder looked around for something to hit him with. The only
thing his eye spotted was the idol. He hobbled over and, using both arms,
dragged it off its dias. Then, with the remainder of his strength, dropped
it squarely on top of whomever was under the skins. There was a muted
clunk followed by silence.

Fearfully Builder stood there for a moment catching his breath and
listening for anyone coming. All was quiet except the pounding of his
heart.

As fast as he could make his arms and hands work he rolled up the body in
the skins and painfully hoisted it over one shoulder. With his other hand
he reached down and picked Thor up by one of its arms, then, staggering
under the load, he started back the way he had come.

Except for a greyish streak in the east, it was still dark. He stumbled
and fell several times before reaching his dwelling, but he was confident
that he had left no tracks. Every night, even this late in the winter, the
ground froze solid.



Back inside his shed, still in the dark, Builder unrolled his burden and
listened for any heartbeat. There was none. As he rolled the body up
again, something clattered to the floor. It was a crutch. Quickly he felt
for his victimâs legs; one was missing. Of all the people he had to
kill--Morge! Thougorâs right hand man.

He realized he had to get rid of the body before daylight and fast!
Already more grey was lining the eastern horizon.

He didnât know whether he had the strength to do it or not, but he had to
get Morge up to the dam and into one of the unfilled molds. For the time
being he would have to hide Thor someplace inside here. He couldnât carry
both of them up to the dam.

He rolled the idol up in another set of skins and placed it under the head
of his sleeping pile. Then, picking up his other bundle once more, he
started for the dam.



The sun was just peeking over the horizon when Builder finally stumbled
back into his dwelling and into bed.

All that day, he lay there, body on fire with fever, and heart pounding
like a drum. He was almost certain he would soon die. "It was just as
well," a little corner of his consciousness said. At least he would be
missing all the frenzied excitement of Thorâs disappearance along with
Morge.

But it looked as though he had failed after all. In spite of removing the
god, now he was dying--and the dam still unfinished.

The day dragged on and on and he didnât die.

After waking up in late afternoon he felt better. He ate a handful of nuts
and figs washed down with a little herb tea. Then as night crept over the
sky, he tottered down to the village.

Whatever had taken place during the day was done, and little groups of
people stood around fires resting and talking--as though it were the old
days before the coming of Thor, thought Builder. That was good.

Builder moved in closer to one of the fires to warm himself against the
early spring night. Someone recognized him--it was one of his workers--and
he was suddenly made welcome, once again being given the place of honor
nearest the fire, as in the old days when heâd first discovered the
humans.

Builder was dumbfounded at the sudden cordiality. In recent days, Thougor
had done such a good job of discrediting, he never dreamed of regaining
his old standing.

Then he was told what had happened during the day while he lay almost
dying:

When the god and Morge were discovered missing, Thougor had called the
village together, explaining that Thor had left them, taking Morge as a
sacrifice because he was dissatisfied with the tribeâs paltry blood
offerings and worship. Therefore a great death sacrifice of young men and
women must be undertaken to pacify Thor and cause his return.

But the people questioned Thougorâs order; they seemed to feel it was the
priest who had been at fault, not themselves. After all, he was the
closest to Thor, was he not? Therefore it was Thougor, not the village,
that Thor had become angered at. And after holding quick council, they had
driven Thougor out into the wilderness, telling him he was not to return
unless Thor was with him.

Old Builder almost cried when he heard this joyful news. The dam would be
completed after all, he was almost certain. He decided to say nothing more
about religion, Thor or Thougor. Maybe soon they would forget the whole
thing. Now he could go back to teaching the youngsters and some of the
brighter oldsters the methods of writing in symbols instead of drawing
pictures.



Hours and days turned into weeks and months as Builder taught his people
what feeble knowledge he possessed in arithmetic, simple engineering--such
as the dam--and most of all, instilling in them the will to want to learn
and investigate and question anything they came in contact with--even the
very thing he was asking them to do.

As the weeks passed on and the dam was completed, he gradually gathered
around him an ardent little group of seeker after that most elusive of all
things--"Truth".

But Builder knew that his days were numbered now, and his work completed;
there was still one thing he had to do, and that was permanently to do
away with Thor by dropping the idol to the bottom of the dam; he still
hadnât examined the god hidden under his sleeping pile.

One evening after returning from a solitary walk above the dam, he entered
his shack and lit a torch, then almost dropped it from shock!

His dwelling was a wreck. The place had been ransacked from top to bottom.
His sleeping pile lay in the middle of the floor--the idol was gone!

He turned and fled from the room, but before he could take a dozen steps
towards the village, several shadows glided out from behind trees and
rocks in the moonlight, resolving themselves into men.

Before he could cry out or struggle, strong arms pinned his arms to his
body and someone clapped a dirty hand over his mouth. He was forced back
into his hovel and the door slammed shut. Standing in front of him was a
very bedraggled figure whom he recognized as Thougor. He also recognized
his three other captors; all were elderly reactionaries of the tribe who
had disapproved of him from the beginning. In spite of his predicament
Builder felt a warm glow of happiness course through him. If these were
the only cronies Thougor could round up, that meant the rest of the
villagers were sympathetic with his cause. He suddenly became aware of
Thougorâs grating voice:

"It took me a little time to piece things together, but once I did, it
didnât take me long to come back and find the god where I might have at
first suspected it would be--right here! For your sacrilege you will pay
with every last drop of blood you have in your scrawny old body--and now!"
Whereupon Thougor disappeared out of the hovel.

Somehow Builder had known they were going to kill him before arousing the
rest of the tribe to the fact that Thor was back. Thougor was taking no
chances of his standing in the way of him or Thor ever again. But Builder
didnât care: he had sown his few seeds of knowledge and wisdom well.
Although Thougor didnât know it, this time he wouldnât have complete
homage from all the tribe. There would now be doubts and questionings and
tests for both Thor and Thougor in the ways of truth and righteousness.

Then Thougor returned to the shack with what, Builder thought, must be
Thor. The hand over his mouth had twisted his head back so that he only
got a glimpse, but he didnât miss the long knife Thougor pulled from
beneath his tattered skins, nor the large sacrificial bowl one of the
others held below his neck. Then his head was tilted forward and sidewise,
and he got his first full look at the god Thor. At the sight, his whole
body shook with smothered laughter. Below the two arms and etched
thunderbolt were large block letters standing out in bold relief:

                                 _THOR_
                         _ Automatic Dishwasher_
                          _ Atomic Powered 1999_

works in creating the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection. Despite these
efforts, Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain âDefects,â such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND â If you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose

refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.

exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state

Section  2.


           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢


Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢âs goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at
http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.


  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please
visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.


      General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergâ¢
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBookâs eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
