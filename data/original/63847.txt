                            GARDEN OF EVIL

                         By MARGARET ST. CLAIR

           Even to a drug-soaked outcast ethnographer Fyhon
             was a paradise planet. It was worth anybody's
           life to find Dridihad, the secret city of dread!

Ericson returned to an awareness of his personal identity quite
suddenly. He had an impression that it was a long time, months at
least, since he had been in a state of normal consciousness. At the
back of his mind a memory of pain had imprinted itself as a signet
makes an impression in hot wax; he shied away from it. "Where am I?"
he asked.

The green-skinned girl squatting beside him in the coppice looked at
him sideways out of her dark jade eyes. "Hungry?" she asked.

"But where am--yes, I am hungry. Yes."

Mnathl--he knew, somehow, that that was her name. Didn't he remember
her from the other side of the gulf in his memory, from the days when
he had begged food in the streets of Penhairn? Mnathl handed him a
nicely-roasted _bosula_ rib. He ate it avidly. He had always thought
the _bosula_ was the best of the food animals of Fyhon.

When the bone was gnawed clean she passed him, in a folded fresh green
leaf, a mixed grill consisting of bits of _bosula_ liver, kidney,
tripe, salivary glands, and eyes. He ate that, too. When his stomach
was full Ericson lay back with his arms under his head and looked at
the big puffy clouds drifting overhead. He had no desire to think about
himself or the things that had been happening to him in the last three
or four months, but the thoughts came anyhow.

The chief thing was pain--remorseless, long-continued, pain. Mnathl had
come to him one day when he was sitting on the dock in Penhairn and
told him they were going to Lake Tanais. He had got up and gone with
her obediently; a _byhror_ addict has little will of his own. The pain
had begun after that.

There had been a barren island in the middle of the brackish, poisonous
waters of the lake, and most of the time, until just latterly, he had
been kept bound for fear he would drown himself in them. Mnathl ...
Mnathl had swum over from the mainland to tend him; she had bathed him
and kept his body free of sores and vermin, set food before him and
tried to coax him to eat. And twice a day she had given him injections
of mercapulan with a hypodermic syringe. His arm was pocked with the
needle marks. Where had she got the syringe and the drug? She must have
stolen them from the big Colony Hospital in Penhairn.

The injections had brought on the pain. Ericson, at the thought, felt
sweat break out on his upper lip. What he had endured had been just at
the edge of what a man could stand and still live. (His ordeal, had
he known it, had been very much less than it would have been had he
taken the drug cure in the hospital in Penhairn. Mnathl, though she had
not disdained the help of terrestrial science, knew things about the
Fyhonese flora and its properties that no terrestrial even suspected.
Still, the ordeal had been bad enough.) Ericson shifted his position
and sighed.

Mnathl had cured him of _byhror_ addiction. In return, he had hated
her. There had been weeks, he remembered, when his brain had held
nothing but horrible pain and the wish to kill Mnathl. Once, when she
had untied him for exercise, he had shammed sleep until she came close
to him; then he had caught her by the throat. He had come close to
killing her then. And no doubt in those long, maniacal days there had
been other times.

Ericson raised himself on one elbow and looked at her. She was pouring
water into a clay pot above the small, workman-like fire she had built,
and was putting in bits of chopped _bosula_ meat. Her greenish skin,
the skin of a native of the South Polar continent, glittered slightly
as she moved. "Mnathl ..." he said.

She turned toward him quickly, but did not speak. "Mnathl, I'm sorry I
tried to ... hurt you on the island. I must have been pretty bad."

Mnathl almost smiled. "No matter," she said. "Pretty soon, soup."

       *       *       *       *       *

The incident seemed to be closed. Ericson lay back in the shade again
and watched the movements of the cloudscape across the deep turquoise
of the sky. His eyes felt as fresh as Adam's. The trees were green
with the greenness of living emeralds, and the sun had an ardor and a
richness like no sun he had ever known before.

Winds blew with caressive, sweet-smelling tendrils over his face, and
from the warm soil beneath him he could almost feel strength soaking up
again into his body cells. He had visited several planets since he had
first left earth; he had loved none of them as he did Fyhon. Fyhon....

Arnaldo, the chunky little head of the paleo-biology department of
Penhairn University, had told him once that terrestrials loved Fyhon so
because conditions on that planet were like those on Terra during the
part of the Cenozoic when man was beginning to become man. Fyhon, he
said, appealed to some deep-seated memory in humanity of what a planet
ought to be.

Ericson had laughed at him. He was new to Fyhon then, with a temporary
appointment as ethnographer to the South Polar Ethnographic Commission.
Racial memory had seemed to him as out-moded a concept as spontaneous
generation. But his temporary appointment had been extended once,
and then once again, and by the end of the second period he had been
wildly, hopelessly in love with Fyhon. He had hoped to get a permanent
appointment, had hoped to stay on Fyhon for the rest of his life.

Ericson sighed again. After a while he raised one hand above his head
and looked at it. He could see the bones and the joints of the bones
and the movements of the sinews under the pale gold skin. The marks of
Mnathl's hypodermic needle were faintly red. He ran his fingers down
his body, surprised at the largeness and hardness of the rib cage, and
the prominence of the sockets of his hips. His body felt attenuated
and worn. But it was his body, no longer the property of _byhror_ and
the _byhror_ emptiness. He held up his hand once more and looked at it
against the light. He was beginning to realize that he was alive.

He drifted off into sleep. When he woke, Mnathl was holding out a
steaming bowl to him. "Soup?" she said.

       *       *       *       *       *

They stayed for some eight days in the coppice, while Ericson knotted
his memories together. _Byhror_ and the need for it were sinking back
with the passage of each successive day into the status of things
unalterably in the past. Mnathl set snares and hunted--she would not
allow him to move a hand--and Ericson watched her almost incuriously.
He felt a little more conscious every hour how good it was to be alive.

On the ninth day Mnathl poured water on the cooking fire. She nested
the cooking pots together, slung them deftly over her shoulder, and
contrived a belt of twisted vines for her hunting knife. "Go now," she
announced.

Ericson got up obediently. "Are we going back to Penhairn?" he asked.

The corners of Mnathl's mouth twitched. "No," she said. "Way on up. On
in. In Dridihad." She pointed with her thumb.

Ericson stared at her. "Dridihad?" he said. He'd heard the name before.
It was ... now wait ... yes, it was the name the natives applied to the
heart of the almost unknown South Polar Minor continent. "I can't go
there. I've got to go back to Penhairn, now that I'm well. I've three
years of _byhror_ addiction to make up."

Mnathl's eyes narrowed. "Dridihad," she repeated stubbornly.

"But.... Listen, Mnathl, I'm terribly grateful to you for what you've
done for me. I never can thank you enough. But I couldn't go to
Dridihad now, wherever it is. I'd need equipment--cameras, notebooks,
guns, a tent. Right now I've got to go back to Penhairn, see about
getting a job."

"All sorts of things to see," Mnathl said. She edged up to him. "You
like. You like good." There was a prick in his arm. Mnathl had made
other things in her cooking pots the last few days beside soup.

Ericson felt a peculiar glassy lethargy creeping over him. The
sensation was not entirely unpleasant. It was as if he looked at his
limbs and his body through a sheet of perfectly transparent crystal. He
could see his actions and his movements with absolute clarity, but he
had nothing to do with them.

"You like see Dridihad," Mnathl said. "All sorts of things for
eth--ethnog--for man like you to look at. Come on. You like good." She
started along a shadowy, green-roofed trail.

While Ericson watched with resentful detachment, his body began
obediently to follow her. Speech as well as volition had deserted him,
and all he could do was to move silently in her steps.

As mile succeeded silent mile, memory and common sense came to his
aid. There had been a time, nearly three years ago, when he had set
out to explore the periphery of the minor polar continent by himself.
His temporary appointment had expired, and he had been moving heaven
and earth to get it made permanent. The one-man expedition had been a
part of the general heaven-and-earth moving process; it had occurred
to him that the Ethnographic Commission might be inclined to view his
application more favorably if he could offer the Commission a piece of
original ethnographic research, such as a report on the natives in the
periphery would be.

His attempt had been a miserable failure; indeed, he owed his former
_byhror_ addiction to it. His supplies had been eaten by animals, he
had poisoned himself with tainted _chornis_ liver, fever had attacked
him. In his fits of feverish delirium he had thrown away nearly
everything, even his hunting knife. In order to get back to Penhairn at
all he had had to resort to chewing the leaves of the _byhror_ plant.
The leaves contain a remarkable stimulant; Ericson had been able to get
his fever-racked body back to civilization alive. But it had been at
the cost of slavish addiction to the drug.

And now Mnathl--bless her greenish skin and queer flat eyes--was
offering him a journey to the mysterious heart of the minor polar
continent. Offering it to him on a silver platter. A piece of original
ethnographic research. He had been ungrateful and a fool. "You like
good," she had said. Well, she ought to know.

The effects of the drug she had pricked his arm with must be wearing
off. Ericson found he could smile. "Why are we going to Dridihad,
Mnathl?" he asked a little later.

Mnathl shook her sleek green head without even turning around to him.
"No," she said.

       *       *       *       *       *

The trip in to Dridihad was a seduction, an enchantment, a bliss.
Ericson's strength came flooding back to him. His sick pallor was
turning to rich gold. On the second day he whittled, under Mnathl's
guidance, a spear and a throwing-stick for it, and on the third and
fourth she taught him to set snares and kindle fires with a sliver
of _onchian_. The country grew wilder and more beautiful, the trees
taller, the sky a deeper blue, the waterfalls more loud. He tried to
question the girl, but she never answered anything except "No", and
after a little, in his happiness, he gave up asking questions.

What did it matter, after all? He was learning from day to day secrets
that any geographer or ethnographer would have given the best years
of his life to learn; the piece of original ethnographic research was
becoming a reality; and who, except a fool, questions someone who has
not only restored him to life but is giving him his heart's desire?

On the eighteenth day, when Ericson's body had filled out and been
turned to a living gold by the sun, they came across the pyramid. It
stood in a swale with purple flowers growing around it and a small
river flowing around one side, and it was so tall that Ericson, looking
dizzily up, swore he saw clouds floating around its top. He wanted
to stay and look at it, to record it in his mind, but Mnathl was not
impressed. She let him have two hours, and then she urged him on.

"But who built it, Mnathl?" he demanded when he had been pulled
reluctantly away. "How did it get here?"

Mnathl seemed to be debating whether to answer him. He could never
decide whether she was naturally taciturn, or whether she really
grudged telling him things. "My people built it," she said at last.
"Deidrithes. Long time ago. _Long_ time ago." She motioned vaguely with
her hand.

Something in the gesture made Ericson see with sudden clarity how deep
the abysm of the past, even on this young world with the ardent sun,
really was. Fyhon was young; but the Deidrithes had been living on
Fyhon a long time.

Two days later Ericson, contrary to their usual custom, was in the
lead, breaking trail. Mnathl caught him suddenly around the waist and
pulled him back, but she was not quick enough. The huge, thick-bodied
snake with the red bandings lashed out at him and just fell short. But
one glistening fang grazed his foot.

[Illustration: _She pushed him back, but not quickly enough._]

Mnathl, bleached by fear to the color of an inferior grade of jade,
killed the snake with a stone. Then she made Ericson sit down on the
grass, and slashed at his foot with her hunting knife.

"What is it, Mnathl?" Ericson asked. The wound was not especially
painful, but his heart had already begun to beat slowly and wearily,
as if beating were a burden almost beyond its strength, and at the same
time it seemed to have grown until it threatened to burst his chest.

"_Outis_," Mnathl answered briefly. She hesitated for a moment. "Bad,"
she said, as if to herself. "Very bad. Could kill me too." Then she
leaned over and set her lips to the bleeding gash her knife had made.

Ericson tried to draw away from her. He was so dizzy that he could
hardly see. "No," he croaked, "don't. You mustn't suck it, Mnathl. I
don't want you to risk your life."

The green-skinned girl shrugged. "No matter," she answered. "Will do.
O.K."

Ericson tried to push her from him, but he was too weak. The world was
receding from him in black waves. She sucked blood and poison from the
wound, spat, sucked, spat, and sucked again.

He would have liked to protest, to thank her for her sacrifice, but he
had no time. His pulse had begun to flutter feebly, and he fainted.

       *       *       *       *       *

For the next several days he was in a stupor most of the time. Whenever
he came back to consciousness, he saw Mnathl lying exhausted in the
grass near him, and he knew without being told that the poison she had
sucked from his wound was moving sluggishly and with slow malignity
through her veins. Nevertheless, the wound on his foot was always
cleanly dressed and plastered with fresh herbs, and from time to time
she opened it with her knife and let the pus escape.

When they were finally on the road to Dridihad again, he tried to thank
her for what she had done.

"Anything I can do for you, Mnathl," he wound up with some
embarrassment (it is difficult to thank someone who refuses to look at
you), "anything I can do for you, why, you let me know. I could have
died there, without ever getting my permanent appointment or seeing
Dridihad. We're friends, aren't we, Mnathl? Friends." He took her hand.

Mnathl nodded curtly. "O.K.," she said. She pulled her fingers from
his. The Deidrithes, Ericson thought not for the first time, were an
impassive, unemotional folk.

It took them nearly a month more to get to Dridihad. On the way
they had to ford two swollen rivers and beat off the attack of a
must-maddened bull _rhodops_. Neither of these incidents had any
consequences. On the sixty-sixth day after their departure from Lake
Tanais, they came to the foot of Dridihad.

For a week or so the ground had been rising steadily and the air
growing crisp and thin. They had labored uphill, uphill. Dridihad
itself, built on a high plateau, had been visible for three days before
they reached it, a silhouette, faintly pinkish, against the clouds.
When they had first caught sight of it, Ericson had felt an almost
painful anticipation seize him, and even Mnathl, usually so impassive,
had shown, in her glowing face and quickened breathing, how excited she
was.

The ascent to the plateau itself, along a path so precipitous that
Ericson was always having to clutch it with hands as well as feet, was
so toilsome that fatigue had dimmed his curiosity a little when they
arrived at the top. Earlier that day Mnathl had thrown the cooking
pots and the knife contemptuously over the side of the cliff, and now,
cupping her hands around her lips and standing almost arrogantly erect,
she strode up to the rosy-red, eroded battlements.

"Klarete laoi!" she called. "Laoi, klarete!" So far as Ericson could
see, no one at all was listening. But after a moment the massy doors of
the gate began to open outward, ponderously, in the twilight. They went
in.

Dridihad, Ericson saw at first glance, was much larger and more
populous than he had supposed from below. The low, stepped buildings,
all made of the rose-pink stone, seemed to stretch out for mile upon
mile, as far as he could see. They made upon him an impression of
antiquity so strong that it was almost disturbing. The small greenish
people like Mnathl were everywhere. In dots, trickles and rivulets they
were pouring out into the streets.

Mnathl's eyes fell on a man near her. She spoke to him. Instantly he
bowed profoundly before her, and made a second, shallower obeisance to
Ericson.

"Go with him," Mnathl said, turning to the ethnographer. "Sleep in his
house." Obediently, Ericson followed his guide. When he looked around
toward Mnathl, she had already disappeared.

The man (his name seemed to be Boator) took Ericson to an airy suite
of rooms on the top floor of one of the biggest of the houses of red
stone. Attendants waited on him with food and drink and water for
bathing. They took away his dirt-encrusted, ragged clothing and brought
him a heavy greenish robe. After Ericson had bathed and put it on, he
inspected himself in the sheet of polished metal that served for a
looking glass and decided that the color of the fabric made his curling
beard and fair skin look as if they had been cast from yellow gold.

He was tired, but far too excited to rest.

The chief thing, the indubitable, the incredible thing, was that there
was a very old, a very populous city, a city whose existence no one had
even suspected, in the heart of the South Polar Minor continent. It was
news to inflame an ethnographer to the point of hysteria. When Ericson
got back to Penhairn with his report, it was going to revolutionize
their whole concept of Fyhonese history; one would hardly exaggerate
to say that it would be epoch-making news. No doubt there would be a
period when they'd consider him the biggest liar since Marco Polo. But
after the first skepticism wore off he'd have a permanent ethnographic
appointment almost forced upon him. His report would shake established
reputations, found new schools, would--oh, if he only had something to
write on!

When the attendant came in again, Ericson made motions of writing in
the palm of his hand, but the man's face remained blank. And when he
asked for Mnathl the attendant merely shook his head and went out.

For want of anything better the young man hung out of the window
watching the smoky flicker of lights in the city around him. It was not
until the last one had gone out that he went, reluctantly, to bed.

       *       *       *       *       *

Next morning, immediately after breakfast, Mnathl came to visit
him. He hardly knew her at first. The scanty garments she had worn
unconcernedly on their journey to Dridihad had been replaced by the
stiff, hieratic folds of a dull purple robe embroidered in blue. On
her head there was a silvery crown of antique workmanship, set with
luminous purple stones, and she moved with the conscious dignity of a
princess or a priest.

Her manner toward him, too, had changed. She smiled faintly when she
first saw him, and everything about her seemed freer than Ericson had
seen it before. She was animated, almost vivacious.

He asked her for something to write with. "No," she answered, still
with that faint smile, "no use. Hunt now."

They left Boator's house by a side door (to avoid the crowd that would
appear at once if they were glimpsed in the streets, Ericson surmised)
and entered a small, walled court. There four improbably striped
animals, about the size of small ponies, were waiting for them. Ericson
mounted one of them, and Mnathl, tucking up her skirts, bestrode
another. With two attendants they rode circuitously through Dridihad
and out into the high plain.

The variety and abundance of game were amazing. There seemed to be more
animals than there were trees, and they came in all sizes, shapes,
colors, and coats. There was even a big blue-hued thing that reminded
the young man a little of a kangaroo. He enjoyed himself, but he could
not help wishing that he knew more about Fyhonese zoology than he
did--to appreciate all those properly.

They got back to the city just before dark. Ericson ate, and then
Mnathl took him to the temple. It was the tallest building in Dridihad,
a stepped pyramid of unusually reddish stone, and Ericson was to grow
fond, later, of the view from its flat top. The naos itself, however,
was a small room skimpily scooped out of one side of the pyramid, and
it was very badly lighted. Ericson, who had resolved, in default of
paper to write on, to impress all he saw and heard irremovably upon his
mind, had to strain his eyes to see anything.

Mnathl officiated. His first feeling that she was a priestess seemed
to be correct. As to the ritual itself, it was highly impressive,
especially when one considered that he did not know the language in
which it was going on. It ended with the sacrifice of an animal like
a _bosula_; while two attendants held it, Mnathl cut its throat,
caught the blood in a cup, and poured it on the altar fire. Then she
roasted pieces of the meat over the coals and dealt them out among
the celebrants of the ceremony, partaking first herself. None of
the collops was offered to Ericson; but, then, he could hardly be
considered a communicant of the religion of the Deidrithes, whatever it
was.

As the days passed, a possible explanation of Mnathl's treatment of
him began to come to Ericson. He was not a conceited man, or it might
have occurred to him earlier. And it bothered him to think that she was
attracted to him, whereas he had never found her attractive in any way.
Still, what other hypothesis would account for the facts?

They were together almost constantly and, except for the attendants
who were always armed with heavy axes, always alone. She hunted with
him, showed him the city, rode with him; she even taught him to play
a rather childish game, something like the Sicilian Mora, which she
always beat him at. Day after day she took him with her to witness
religious rites which were obviously of the most hallowed character.
Ericson had the impression that the rites were leading, in a series of
slight graduations, up to some supreme event! and he tried to note and
remember everything.

       *       *       *       *       *

The climax came suddenly. One lovely evening, just as the full moon was
rising, Mnathl took him with her up the steep sides to the top of the
pyramid. The two attendants hovered discreetly in the background. For
all practical purposes, he and the girl were alone.

Mnathl looked at him. There was a glint, warm, glowing, and facile, in
her eyes that he had never seen there before. There was a short but
rather embarrassing silence. At last Ericson, feeling like a boor and
a churl, took her hand.

"Mnathl," he said, "I'm so grateful to you. You've done so much for me,
helped me so much. You ... mean a lot to me, Mnathl." That, at least,
was true.

Mnathl pulled her fingers away and regarded him. "What you mean?" she
asked blankly. "What you mean?"

"That you ... that I ..." he stopped, too embarrassed to go on.

Mnathl threw back her head and laughed. It was the first time he had
ever heard the sound from her, and there was something strange in it.
She motioned to the axmen with her hand.

"Not like, not hate," she said blandly. "Let you see, let you hear, so
you tell Them all that Deidrithes do. You our messenger. Then we eat."

Then we eat.... For a moment the words echoed meaninglessly in
Ericson's mind. The axmen were forcing him to his knees near a
depression in the center of the pyramid. "But why ..." he said.

"We hear about you the first time you try trip," Mnathl said.
"Everybody know. No other men your color in Fyhon."

His color. Ericson began to understand. Mnathl's devotion, her
self-sacrificing tenacity, her long kindness to him, everything--had
all been nothing but the prelude to a ritual meal in which his rare
blonde body was to be the chief support. No doubt a man of his color
would be an especially choice offering to the gods. The gleam he had
seen in Mnathl's eyes had been not love, but a kind of religious
gluttony.

He began to laugh. Irony had always appealed to him; and besides he was
remembering a sentence in the Ethnographic Commission's preliminary
survey: "There is no doubt that ritual cannibalism is unknown among the
natives of Fyhon."

"O.K., Mnathl," he said, recalling what he had been saved from, what he
had seen and learned. "I'm ahead, no matter how you look at it. It's
O.K."

He was still smiling when the axman on the right struck and Ericson's
severed head went rolling along the surface of the pyramid.

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
